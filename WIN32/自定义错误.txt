/*Error codes are 32-bit values (bit 31 is the most significant bit).Bit 29 is reserved 
  for application-defined error codes; no system error code has this bit set.If you are
  defining an error code for your application, set this bit to one. That indicates that 
  the error code has been defined by an application, and ensures that your error code 
  does not conflict with any error codes defined by the system. */
