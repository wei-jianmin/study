NAME
       openvpn - Secure IP tunnel daemon
SYNOPSIS
       openvpn [ options ... ]
       openvpn  --help
INTRODUCTION
       OpenVPN  is an open source VPN daemon by James Yonan. Because OpenVPN tries to be a universal VPN tool offering a great deal of flexibility, there are a lot
       of options on this manual page. If you're new to OpenVPN, you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you will see how  to  construct  simple
       VPNs on the command line without even needing a configuration file.
       Also note that there's more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN web site: https://openvpn.net/
       And  if  you  would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the openvpn usage message which can be obtained by running openvpn without any parameters.
DESCRIPTION
       OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN supports SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel  transport  through  proxies  or
       NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most major OS platforms.
       OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto capabilities from it.
       OpenVPN  supports  conventional  encryption using a pre-shared secret key (Static Key mode) or public key security (SSL/TLS mode) using client & server certificates. OpenVPN also supports non-encrypted TCP/UDP tunnels.
       OpenVPN is designed to work with the TUN/TAP virtual networking interface that exists on most platforms.
       Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but with a relatively lightweight footprint.
OPTIONS
       OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file. Though all command line options are preceded by a double-leading-dash ("--"), this prefix can be removed when an option is placed in a configuration file.
   Generic Options
       This section covers generic options which are accessible regardless of which mode OpenVPN is configured as.
       --help Show options.
       --auth-nocache
              Don't cache --askpass or --auth-user-pass username/passwords in virtual memory.
              If specified, this directive will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget username/password inputs after they are used. As a result, when OpenVPN needs a
              username/password, it will prompt for input from stdin, which may be multiple times during the duration of an OpenVPN session.
              When using --auth-nocache in combination with a user/password file and --chroot or --daemon, make sure to use an absolute path.
              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.  It is always cached.
       --cd dir
              Change directory to dir prior to reading any files such as configuration files, key files, scripts, etc. dir should be an absolute path, with a leading "/", and without any references to the current directory such as . or ...
              This option is useful when you are running OpenVPN in --daemon mode, and you want to consolidate all of your OpenVPN control files in one location.
       --chroot dir
              Chroot to dir after initialization. --chroot essentially redefines dir as being the top level directory tree (/). OpenVPN will therefore be unable to
              access any files outside this tree. This can be desirable from a security standpoint.
              Since the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization, most OpenVPN options that reference files will operate in a pre-chroot context.
              In many cases, the dir parameter can point to an empty directory, however complications can result when scripts or restarts are  executed  after  the
              chroot operation.
              Note:  The  SSL  library  will probably need /dev/urandom to be available inside the chroot directory dir. This is because SSL libraries occasionally
              need to collect fresh random. Newer linux kernels and some BSDs implement a getrandom() or getentropy() syscall that removes the need for  /dev/urandom to be available.
       --config file
              Load additional config options from file where each line corresponds to one command line option, but with the leading '--' removed.
              If --config file is the only option to the openvpn command, the --config can be removed, and the command can be given as openvpn file
              Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.
              Double quotation or single quotation characters ("", '') can be used to enclose single parameters containing whitespace, and "#" or ";" characters in
              the first column can be used to denote comments.
              Note that OpenVPN 2.0 and higher performs backslash-based shell escaping for characters not in single quotations, so the following mappings should be
              observed:
                 \\       Maps to a single backslash character (\).
                 \"       Pass a literal doublequote character ("), don't
                          interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
                 \[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don't
                          interpret it as a parameter delimiter.
              For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:
                 secret "c:\\OpenVPN\\secret.key"
              For examples of configuration files, see https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/
              Here is an example configuration file:
                 #
                 # Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
                 # using a pre-shared static key.
                 #
                 # '#' or ';' may be used to delimit comments.
                 # Use a dynamic tun device.
                 dev tun
                 # Our remote peer
                 remote mypeer.mydomain
                 # 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
                 # 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint
                 ifconfig 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2
                 # Our pre-shared static key
                 secret static.key
       --daemon progname
              Become  a  daemon after all initialization functions are completed. This option will cause all message and error output to be sent to the syslog file
              (such as /var/log/messages), except for the output of scripts and ifconfig commands, which will go to /dev/null unless otherwise redirected. The syslog  redirection occurs immediately at the point that --daemon is parsed on the command line even though the daemonization point occurs later. If one
              of the --log options is present, it will supersede syslog redirection.
              The optional progname parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its program name to the system logger as progname. This can be useful in linking OpenVPN
              messages in the syslog file with specific tunnels. When unspecified, progname defaults to "openvpn".
              When  OpenVPN is run with the --daemon option, it will try to delay daemonization until the majority of initialization functions which are capable of
              generating fatal errors are complete. This means that initialization scripts can test the return status of the openvpn command for a fairly  reliable
              indication of whether the command has correctly initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.
              In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are non-fatal.
              Note:  as soon as OpenVPN has daemonized, it can not ask for usernames, passwords, or key pass phrases anymore. This has certain consequences, namely
              that using a password-protected private key will fail unless the --askpass option is used to tell OpenVPN to ask for the pass phrase  (this  requirement is new in v2.3.7, and is a consequence of calling daemon() before initializing the crypto layer).
              Further,  using --daemon together with --auth-user-pass (entered on console) and --auth-nocache will fail as soon as key renegotiation (and reauthentication) occurs.
       --disable-occ
              Don't output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected between peers. An example of an option inconsistency would be  where  one  peer
              uses --dev tun while the other peer uses --dev tap.
              Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as a temporary fix in situations where a recent version of OpenVPN must connect to an old version.
       --engine engine-name
              Enable OpenSSL hardware-based crypto engine functionality.
              If engine-name is specified, use a specific crypto engine. Use the --show-engines standalone option to list the crypto engines which are supported by
              OpenSSL.
       --fast-io
              (Experimental) Optimize TUN/TAP/UDP I/O writes by avoiding a call to poll/epoll/select prior to the write operation. The purpose of such a call would
              normally  be  to  block  until  the device or socket is ready to accept the write. Such blocking is unnecessary on some platforms which don't support
              write blocking on UDP sockets or TUN/TAP devices. In such cases, one can optimize the event loop by avoiding the  poll/epoll/select  call,  improving
              CPU efficiency by 5% to 10%.
              This option can only be used on non-Windows systems, when --proto udp is specified, and when --shaper is NOT specified.
       --group group
              Similar to the --user option, this option changes the group ID of the OpenVPN process to group after initialization.
       --ignore-unknown-option args
              Valid syntax:
                 ignore-unknown-options opt1 opt2 opt3 ... optN
              When  one of options opt1 ... optN is encountered in the configuration file the configuration file parsing does not fail if this OpenVPN version does
              not support the option. Multiple --ignore-unknown-option options can be given to support a larger number of options to ignore.
              This option should be used with caution, as there are good security reasons for having OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file.   Having
              said that, there are valid reasons for wanting new software features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software versions.
              --ignore-unknown-option is available since OpenVPN 2.3.3.
       --iproute cmd
              Set alternate command to execute instead of default iproute2 command.  May be used in order to execute OpenVPN in unprivileged environment.
       --keying-material-exporter args
              Save  Exported  Keying  Material [RFC5705] of len bytes (must be between 16 and 4095 bytes) using label in environment (exported_keying_material) for
              use by plugins in OPENVPN_PLUGIN_TLS_FINAL callback.
              Valid syntax:
                 keying-material-exporter label len
              Note that exporter labels have the potential to collide with existing PRF labels. In order to prevent this, labels MUST begin with EXPORTER.
       --mlock
              Disable paging by calling the POSIX mlockall function. Requires that OpenVPN be initially run as root (though OpenVPN can subsequently downgrade  its
              UID using the --user option).
              Using  this option ensures that key material and tunnel data are never written to disk due to virtual memory paging operations which occur under most
              modern operating systems. It ensures that even if an attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he would not be able to scan the system swap
              file to recover previously used ephemeral keys, which are used for a period of time governed by the --reneg options (see below), then are discarded.
              The downside of using --mlock is that it will reduce the amount of physical memory available to other applications.
              The  limit  on how much memory can be locked and how that limit is enforced are OS-dependent. On Linux the default limit that an unprivileged process
              may lock (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) is low, and if privileges are dropped later, future memory allocations will very likely fail. The limit  can  be  increased
              using ulimit or systemd directives depending on how OpenVPN is started.
       --nice n
              Change process priority after initialization (n greater than 0 is lower priority, n less than zero is higher priority).
       --persist-key
              Don't re-read key files across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart.
              This  option  can  be combined with --user nobody to allow restarts triggered by the SIGUSR1 signal. Normally if you drop root privileges in OpenVPN,
              the daemon cannot be restarted since it will now be unable to re-read protected key files.
              This option solves the problem by persisting keys across SIGUSR1 resets, so they don't need to be re-read.
       --remap-usr1 signal
              Control whether internally or externally generated SIGUSR1 signals are remapped to SIGHUP (restart without persisting state) or SIGTERM (exit).
              signal can be set to SIGHUP or SIGTERM. By default, no remapping occurs.
       --script-security level
              This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external programs and scripts. Lower level values  are  more  restrictive,  higher
              values are more permissive. Settings for level:
              0      Strictly no calling of external programs.
              1      (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or netsh.
              2      Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts.
              3      Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables (potentially unsafe).
              OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a method flag which indicated how OpenVPN should call external commands and scripts. This could be either
              execve or system. As of OpenVPN 2.3, this flag is no longer accepted. In most *nix environments the execve() approach has been used without  any  issues.
              Some  directives such as --up allow options to be passed to the external script. In these cases make sure the script name does not contain any spaces
              or the configuration parser will choke because it can't determine where the script name ends and script options start.
              To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to either add a full path to the script interpreter which can parse  the  script  or
              use  the  system flag to run these scripts. As of OpenVPN 2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have full path to the script interpreter when running
              non-executables files. This is not needed for executable files, such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files. For example,  if  you  have  a  Visual  Basic
              script, you must use this syntax now:
                 --up 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe C:\\Program\ Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\my-up-script.vbs'
              Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes (\) and the space character.
              The  reason the support for the system flag was removed is due to the security implications with shell expansions when executing scripts via the system() call.
       --setcon context
              Apply SELinux context after initialization. This essentially provides the ability to restrict OpenVPN's rights to only network I/O operations, thanks
              to  SELinux.  This goes further than --user and --chroot in that those two, while being great security features, unfortunately do not protect against
              privilege escalation by exploitation of a vulnerable system call. You can of course combine all three, but please note that since setcon requires access to /proc you will have to provide it inside the chroot directory (e.g. with mount --bind).
              Since the setcon operation is delayed until after initialization, OpenVPN can be restricted to just network-related system calls, whereas by applying
              the context before startup (such as the OpenVPN one provided in the SELinux Reference Policies) you will have to allow many things required only during initialization.
              Like  with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are executed after the setcon operation, which is why you should really consider
              using the --persist-key and --persist-tun options.
       --status args
              Write operational status to file every n seconds.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 status file
                 status file n
              Status can also be written to the syslog by sending a SIGUSR2 signal.
              With multi-client capability enabled on a server, the status file includes a list of clients and a routing table. The output format can be controlled
              by the --status-version option in that case.
              For clients or instances running in point-to-point mode, it will contain the traffic statistics.
       --status-version n
              Set the status file format version number to n.
              This only affects the status file on servers with multi-client capability enabled.  Valid status version values:
              1      Traditional  format (default). The client list contains the following fields comma-separated: Common Name, Real Address, Bytes Received, Bytes
                     Sent, Connected Since.
              2      A more reliable format for external processing. Compared to version 1, the client list contains some additional fields: Virtual Address,  Virtual IPv6 Address, Username, Client ID, Peer ID, Data Channel Cipher. Future versions may extend the number of fields.
              3      Identical to 2, but fields are tab-separated.
       --test-crypto
              Do a self-test of OpenVPN's crypto options by encrypting and decrypting test packets using the data channel encryption options specified above.  This
              option does not require a peer to function, and therefore can be specified without --dev or --remote.
              The typical usage of --test-crypto would be something like this:
                 openvpn --test-crypto --secret key
              or
                 openvpn --test-crypto --secret key --verb 9
              This option is very useful to test OpenVPN after it has been ported to a new platform, or to isolate problems in the  compiler,  OpenSSL  crypto  library,  or  OpenVPN's crypto code. Since it is a self-test mode, problems with encryption and authentication can be debugged independently of network
              and tunnel issues.
       --tmp-dir dir
              Specify a directory dir for temporary files. This directory will be used by openvpn processes and script to communicate temporary data  with  openvpn
              main process. Note that the directory must be writable by the OpenVPN process after it has dropped it's root privileges.
              This directory will be used by in the following cases:
              • --client-connect  scripts  and OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT plug-in hook to dynamically generate client-specific configuration client_connect_config_file and return success/failure via client_connect_deferred_file when using deferred client connect method
              • OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY plug-in hooks returns success/failure via auth_control_file when using deferred auth method
              • OPENVPN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_PF plugin hook to pass filtering rules via pf_file
       --use-prediction-resistance
              Enable prediction resistance on mbed TLS's RNG.
              Enabling prediction resistance causes the RNG to reseed in each call for random. Reseeding this often can quickly deplete the kernel entropy pool.
              If you need this option, please consider running a daemon that adds entropy to the kernel pool.
       --user user
              Change the user ID of the OpenVPN process to user after initialization, dropping privileges in the process. This option is useful to protect the system in the event that some hostile party was able to gain control of an OpenVPN session. Though OpenVPN's security features make this unlikely, it is
              provided as a second line of defense.
              By setting user to nobody or somebody similarly unprivileged, the hostile party would be limited in what damage they could cause. Of course once  you
              take  away  privileges, you cannot return them to an OpenVPN session. This means, for example, that if you want to reset an OpenVPN daemon with a SIGUSR1 signal (for example in response to a DHCP reset), you should make use of one or more of the --persist options to ensure  that  OpenVPN  doesn't
              need to execute any privileged operations in order to restart (such as re-reading key files or running ifconfig on the TUN device).
       --writepid file
              Write OpenVPN's main process ID to file.
   Log options
       --echo parms
              Echo parms to log output.
              Designed to be used to send messages to a controlling application which is receiving the OpenVPN log output.
       --errors-to-stderr
              Output errors to stderr instead of stdout unless log output is redirected by one of the --log options.
       --log file
              Output logging messages to file, including output to stdout/stderr which is generated by called scripts. If file already exists it will be truncated.
              This option takes effect immediately when it is parsed in the command line and will supersede syslog output if --daemon or --inetd is also specified.
              This option is persistent over the entire course of an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be reset by SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, or --ping-restart.
              Note that on Windows, when OpenVPN is started as a service, logging occurs by default without the need to specify this option.
       --log-append file
              Append logging messages to file.  If file does not exist, it will be created. This option behaves exactly like --log except that it appends to rather
              than truncating the log file.
       --machine-readable-output
              Always write timestamps and message flags to log messages, even when they otherwise would not be prefixed. In particular, this applies  to  log  messages sent to stdout.
       --mute n
              Log at most n consecutive messages in the same category. This is useful to limit repetitive logging of similar message types.
       --mute-replay-warnings
              Silence  the  output of replay warnings, which are a common false alarm on WiFi networks. This option preserves the security of the replay protection
              code without the verbosity associated with warnings about duplicate packets.
       --suppress-timestamps
              Avoid writing timestamps to log messages, even when they otherwise would be prepended. In particular, this applies to log messages sent to stdout.
       --syslog progname
              Direct log output to system logger, but do not become a daemon. See --daemon directive above for description of progname parameter.
       --verb n
              Set output verbosity to n (default 1). Each level shows all info from the previous levels. Level 3 is recommended if  you  want  a  good  summary  of
              what's happening without being swamped by output.
              0      No output except fatal errors.
              1 to 4 Normal usage range.
              5      Outputs  R  and  W  characters  to the console for each packet read and write, uppercase is used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for
                     TUN/TAP packets.
              6 to 11
                     Debug info range (see errlevel.h in the source code for additional information on debug levels).
   Protocol options
       Options in this section affect features available in the OpenVPN wire protocol.  Many of these options also define the encryption options of the data  channel in the OpenVPN wire protocol.  These options must be configured in a compatible way between both the local and remote side.
       --allow-compression mode
              As  described  in the --compress option, compression is a potentially dangerous option.  This option allows controlling the behaviour of OpenVPN when
              compression is used and allowed.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 allow-compression
                 allow-compression mode
              The mode argument can be one of the following values:
              asym (default)
                     OpenVPN will only decompress downlink packets but not compress uplink packets.  This also allows migrating to disable compression when  changing both server and client configurations to remove compression at the same time is not a feasible option.
              no     OpenVPN will refuse any non-stub compression.
              yes    OpenVPN will send and receive compressed packets.
       --auth alg
              Authenticate  data  channel  packets  and (if enabled) tls-auth control channel packets with HMAC using message digest algorithm alg. (The default is
              SHA1 ). HMAC is a commonly used message authentication algorithm (MAC) that uses a data string, a secure hash algorithm and a key to produce a  digital signature.
              The OpenVPN data channel protocol uses encrypt-then-mac (i.e. first encrypt a packet then HMAC the resulting ciphertext), which prevents padding oracle attacks.
              If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen then the specified --auth algorithm is ignored for the data channel and the authentication method of  the
              AEAD cipher is used instead. Note that alg still specifies the digest used for tls-auth.
              In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the key file generated by --genkey. In TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically generated and
              shared between peers via the TLS control channel. If OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will drop the packet. HMAC usually adds  16  or  20
              bytes per packet. Set alg=none to disable authentication.
              For more information on HMAC see http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html
       --cipher alg
              This option is deprecated for server-client mode. --data-ciphers or possibly --data-ciphers-fallback` should be used instead.
              Encrypt data channel packets with cipher algorithm alg.
              The default is BF-CBC, an abbreviation for Blowfish in Cipher Block Chaining mode. When cipher negotiation (NCP) is allowed, OpenVPN 2.4 and newer on
              both client and server side will automatically upgrade to AES-256-GCM.  See --data-ciphers and --ncp-disable for more details on NCP.
              Using BF-CBC is no longer recommended, because of its 64-bit block size. This small block size allows attacks based on collisions, as demonstrated by
              SWEET32.  See  https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32 for details. Due to this, support for BF-CBC, DES, CAST5, IDEA and RC2 ciphers will
              be removed in OpenVPN 2.6.
              To see other ciphers that are available with OpenVPN, use the --show-ciphers option.
              Set alg to none to disable encryption.
       --compress algorithm
              DEPRECATED Enable a compression algorithm.  Compression is generally not recommended.  VPN tunnels which use compression are susceptible to  the  VORALCE attack vector.
              The algorithm parameter may be lzo, lz4, lz4-v2, stub, stub-v2 or empty.  LZO and LZ4 are different compression algorithms, with LZ4 generally offering the best performance with least CPU usage.
              The lz4-v2 and stub-v2 variants implement a better framing that does not add overhead when packets cannot be compressed. All  other  variants  always
              add one extra framing byte compared to no compression framing.
              If  the  algorithm parameter is stub, stub-v2 or empty, compression will be turned off, but the packet framing for compression will still be enabled,
              allowing a different setting to be pushed later.  Additionally, stub and stub-v2 wil disable announcing lzo and lz4 compression support via IV_ variables to the server.
              Note: the stub (or empty) option is NOT compatible with the older option --comp-lzo no.
              *Security Considerations*
              Compression  and encryption is a tricky combination. If an attacker knows or is able to control (parts of) the plain-text of packets that contain secrets, the attacker might be able to extract the secret if compression is enabled. See e.g. the CRIME and BREACH attacks on TLS and VORACLE  on  VPNs
              which  also  leverage  to break encryption. If you are not entirely sure that the above does not apply to your traffic, you are advised to not enable
              compression.
       --comp-lzo mode
              DEPRECATED Enable LZO compression algorithm.  Compression is generally not recommended.  VPN tunnels which uses compression are  suspectible  to  the
              VORALCE attack vector.
              Use LZO compression -- may add up to 1 byte per packet for incompressible data. mode may be yes, no, or adaptive (default).
              In a server mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn compression on or off for individual clients.
              First,  make  sure the client-side config file enables selective compression by having at least one --comp-lzo directive, such as --comp-lzo no. This
              will turn off compression by default, but allow a future directive push from the server to dynamically change the on/off/adaptive setting.
              Next in a --client-config-dir file, specify the compression setting for the client, for example:
                 comp-lzo yes
                 push "comp-lzo yes"
              The first line sets the comp-lzo setting for the server side of the link, the second sets the client side.
       --comp-noadapt
              DEPRECATED When used in conjunction with --comp-lzo, this option will disable OpenVPN's adaptive compression algorithm. Normally,  adaptive  compression is enabled with --comp-lzo.
              Adaptive  compression  tries  to  optimize the case where you have compression enabled, but you are sending predominantly incompressible (or pre-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as an FTP or rsync transfer of a large, compressed file. With adaptive compression, OpenVPN will  periodically
              sample  the  compression  process to measure its efficiency. If the data being sent over the tunnel is already compressed, the compression efficiency
              will be very low, triggering openvpn to disable compression for a period of time until the next re-sample test.
       --key-direction
              Alternative way of specifying the optional direction parameter for the --tls-auth and --secret options. Useful when using inline files  (See  section
              on inline files).
       --keysize n
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.6.
              Size of cipher key in bits (optional). If unspecified, defaults to cipher-specific default. The --show-ciphers option (see below) shows all available
              OpenSSL ciphers, their default key sizes, and whether the key size can be changed. Use care in changing a cipher's default  key  size.  Many  ciphers
              have  not been extensively cryptanalyzed with non-standard key lengths, and a larger key may offer no real guarantee of greater security, or may even
              reduce security.
       --data-ciphers cipher-list
              Restrict the allowed ciphers to be negotiated to the ciphers in cipher-list. cipher-list is a  colon-separated  list  of  ciphers,  and  defaults  to
              AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM.
              For servers, the first cipher from cipher-list that is also supported by the client will be pushed to clients that support cipher negotiation.
              Cipher negotiation is enabled in client-server mode only. I.e. if --mode is set to 'server' (server-side, implied by setting --server ), or if --pull
              is specified (client-side, implied by setting --client).
              If no common cipher is found during cipher negotiation, the connection is terminated. To support old clients/old servers that do not provide any  cipher negotiation support see --data-ciphers-fallback.
              Additionally,  to  allow  for more smooth transition, if NCP is enabled, OpenVPN will inherit the cipher of the peer if that cipher is different from
              the local --cipher setting, but the peer cipher is one of the ciphers specified in --data-ciphers. E.g. a non-NCP client (<=v2.3, or with  --ncp-disabled  set) connecting to a NCP server (v2.4+) with --cipher BF-CBC and --data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-256-CBC set can either specify --cipher BF-CBC
              or --cipher AES-256-CBC and both will work.
              Note for using NCP with an OpenVPN 2.4 peer: This list must include the AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM ciphers.
              This list is restricted to be 127 chars long after conversion to OpenVPN ciphers.
              This option was called --ncp-ciphers in OpenVPN 2.4 but has been renamed to --data-ciphers in OpenVPN 2.5 to more accurately reflect its meaning.
       --data-ciphers-fallback alg
              Configure a cipher that is used to fall back to if we could not determine which cipher the peer is willing to use.
              This option should only be needed to connect to peers that are running OpenVPN 2.3 and older version, and have been  configured  with  --enable-small
              (typically used on routers or other embedded devices).
       --ncp-disable
              DEPRECATED Disable "Negotiable Crypto Parameters". This completely disables cipher negotiation.
       --secret args
              Enable Static Key encryption mode (non-TLS). Use pre-shared secret file which was generated with --genkey.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 secret file
                 secret file direction
              The optional direction parameter enables the use of 4 distinct keys (HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so that each data flow
              direction has a different set of HMAC and cipher keys. This has a number of desirable security properties including eliminating certain kinds of  DoS
              and message replay attacks.
              When the direction parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirectionally, one for HMAC and the other for encryption/decryption.
              The  direction  parameter  should always be complementary on either side of the connection, i.e. one side should use 0 and the other should use 1, or
              both sides should omit it altogether.
              The direction parameter requires that file contains a 2048 bit key. While pre-1.5 versions of OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key  files,  any  version  of
              OpenVPN which supports the direction parameter, will also support 2048 bit key file generation using the --genkey option.
              Static key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being ease of configuration.
              There  are  no  certificates  or certificate authorities or complicated negotiation handshakes and protocols. The only requirement is that you have a
              pre-existing secure channel with your peer (such as ssh) to initially copy the key. This requirement, along with the fact that your key never changes
              unless you manually generate a new one, makes it somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below). If an attacker manages to steal your key, everything
              that was ever encrypted with it is compromised. Contrast that to the perfect forward secrecy features of TLS  mode  (using  Diffie  Hellman  key  exchange), where even if an attacker was able to steal your private key, he would gain no information to help him decrypt past sessions.
              Another  advantageous  aspect  of  Static Key encryption mode is that it is a handshake-free protocol without any distinguishing signature or feature
              (such as a header or protocol handshake sequence) that would mark the ciphertext packets as being generated by OpenVPN. Anyone eavesdropping  on  the
              wire would see nothing but random-looking data.
       --tran-window n
              Transition  window -- our old key can live this many seconds after a new a key renegotiation begins (default 3600 seconds). This feature allows for a
              graceful transition from old to new key, and removes the key renegotiation sequence from the critical path of tunnel data forwarding.
   Client Options
       The client options are used when connecting to an OpenVPN server configured to use --server, --server-bridge, or --mode server in its configuration.
       --allow-pull-fqdn
              Allow client to pull DNS names from server (rather than being limited to IP address) for --ifconfig, --route, and --route-gateway.
       --allow-recursive-routing
              When this option is set, OpenVPN will not drop incoming tun packets with same destination as host.
       --auth-token token
              This is not an option to be used directly in any configuration files, but rather push this option from a --client-connect script or a --plugin  which
              hooks  into  the  OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT  or OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2 calls. This option provides a possibility to replace the clients
              password with an authentication token during the lifetime of the OpenVPN client.
              Whenever the connection is renegotiated and the --auth-user-pass-verify script or --plugin making  use  of  the  OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY
              hook is triggered, it will pass over this token as the password instead of the password the user provided. The authentication token can only be reset
              by a full reconnect where the server can push new options to the client. The password the user entered is never preserved once an authentication  token has been set. If the OpenVPN server side rejects the authentication token then the client will receive an AUTH_FAILED and disconnect.
              The  purpose of this is to enable two factor authentication methods, such as HOTP or TOTP, to be used without needing to retrieve a new OTP code each
              time the connection is renegotiated. Another use case is to cache authentication data on the client without needing to have the users password cached
              in memory during the life time of the session.
              To make use of this feature, the --client-connect script or --plugin needs to put
                 push "auth-token UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE"
              into  the file/buffer for dynamic configuration data. This will then make the OpenVPN server to push this value to the client, which replaces the local password with the UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE.
              Newer clients (2.4.7+) will fall back to the original password method after a failed auth. Older clients will keep using the token  value  and  react
              according to --auth-retry
       --auth-token-user base64username
              Companion option to --auth-token. This options allows to override the username used by the client when reauthenticating with the auth-token.  It also
              allows to use --auth-token in setups that normally do not use username and password.
              The username has to be base64 encoded.
       --auth-user-pass
              Authenticate with server using username/password.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 auth-user-pass
                 auth-user-pass up
              If up is present, it must be a file containing username/password on 2 lines. If the password line is missing, OpenVPN will prompt for one.
              If up is omitted, username/password will be prompted from the console.
              The server configuration must specify an --auth-user-pass-verify script to verify the username/password provided by the client.
       --auth-retry type
              Controls how OpenVPN responds to username/password verification errors such as the client-side response to an AUTH_FAILED message from the server  or
              verification failure of the private key password.
              Normally used to prevent auth errors from being fatal on the client side, and to permit username/password requeries in case of error.
              An  AUTH_FAILED message is generated by the server if the client fails --auth-user-pass authentication, or if the server-side --client-connect script
              returns an error status when the client tries to connect.
              type can be one of:
              none   Client will exit with a fatal error (this is the default).
              nointeract
                     Client will retry the connection without requerying for an --auth-user-pass username/password. Use this option for unattended clients.
              interact
                     Client will requery for an --auth-user-pass username/password and/or private key password before attempting a reconnection.
              Note that while this option cannot be pushed, it can be controlled from the management interface.
       --client
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's client mode. This directive is equivalent to:
                 pull
                 tls-client
       --client-nat args
              This pushable client option sets up a stateless one-to-one NAT rule on packet addresses (not ports), and is useful in cases where routes or  ifconfig
              settings pushed to the client would create an IP numbering conflict.
              Examples:
                 client-nat snat 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
                 client-nat dnat 10.64.0.0/255.255.0.0
              network/netmask  (for example 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0) defines the local view of a resource from the client perspective, while alias/netmask (for example 10.64.0.0/255.255.0.0) defines the remote view from the server perspective.
              Use snat (source NAT) for resources owned by the client and dnat (destination NAT) for remote resources.
              Set --verb 6 for debugging info showing the transformation of src/dest addresses in packets.
       --connect-retry n
              Wait n seconds between connection attempts (default 5).  Repeated reconnection attempts are slowed down after 5 retries per remote  by  doubling  the
              wait  time after each unsuccessful attempt. An optional argument max specifies the maximum value of wait time in seconds at which it gets capped (default 300).
       --connect-retry-max n
              n specifies the number of times each --remote or <connection> entry is tried. Specifying n as 1 would try each entry exactly once. A successful  connection resets the counter.  (default unlimited).
       --connect-timeout n
              See --server-poll-timeout.
       --explicit-exit-notify n
              In UDP client mode or point-to-point mode, send server/peer an exit notification if tunnel is restarted or OpenVPN process is exited. In client mode,
              on exit/restart, this option will tell the server to immediately close its client instance object rather than waiting for a timeout.
              The n parameter (default 1 if not present) controls the maximum number of attempts that the client will try to resend the exit notification message.
              In UDP server mode, send RESTART control channel command to connected clients. The n parameter (default 1 if not present) controls  client  behavior.
              With n = 1 client will attempt to reconnect to the same server, with n = 2 client will advance to the next server.
              OpenVPN will not send any exit notifications unless this option is enabled.
       --inactive args
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after n seconds of inactivity on the TUN/TAP device. The time length of inactivity is measured since the last incoming or outgoing tunnel packet. The default value is 0 seconds, which disables this feature.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 inactive n
                 inactive n bytes
              If the optional bytes parameter is included, exit if less than bytes of combined in/out traffic are produced on the tun/tap device in n seconds.
              In any case, OpenVPN's internal ping packets (which are just keepalives) and TLS control packets are not considered "activity", nor are they  counted
              as traffic, as they are used internally by OpenVPN and are not an indication of actual user activity.
       --proto-force p
              When iterating through connection profiles, only consider profiles using protocol p (tcp | udp).
       --pull This  option  must  be used on a client which is connecting to a multi-client server. It indicates to OpenVPN that it should accept options pushed by
              the server, provided they are part of the legal set of pushable options (note that the --pull option is implied by --client ).
              In particular, --pull allows the server to push routes to the client, so you should not use --pull or --client in situations where  you  don't  trust
              the server to have control over the client's routing table.
       --pull-filter args
              Filter options on the client pushed by the server to the client.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 pull-filter accept text
                 pull-filter ignore text
                 pull-filter reject text
              Filter options received from the server if the option starts with text.  The action flag accept allows the option, ignore removes it and reject flags
              an error and triggers a SIGUSR1 restart. The filters may be specified multiple times, and each filter is applied in the order it  is  specified.  The
              filtering of each option stops as soon as a match is found. Unmatched options are accepted by default.
              Prefix comparison is used to match text against the received option so that
                 pull-filter ignore "route"
              would remove all pushed options starting with route which would include, for example, route-gateway. Enclose text in quotes to embed spaces.
                 pull-filter accept "route 192.168.1."
                 pull-filter ignore "route "
              would remove all routes that do not start with 192.168.1.
              Note  that  reject  may  result in a repeated cycle of failure and reconnect, unless multiple remotes are specified and connection to the next remote
              succeeds. To silently ignore an option pushed by the server, use ignore.
       --push-peer-info
              Push additional information about the client to server. The following data is always pushed to the server:
              IV_VER=<version>
                     The client OpenVPN version
              IV_PLAT=[linux|solaris|openbsd|mac|netbsd|freebsd|win]
                     The client OS platform
              IV_LZO_STUB=1
                     If client was built with LZO stub capability
              IV_LZ4=1
                     If the client supports LZ4 compressions.
              IV_PROTO
                     Details about protocol extensions that the peer supports. The variable is a bitfield and the bits are defined as follows (starting a bit 0 for
                     the first (unused) bit:
                     • bit 1: The peer supports peer-id floating mechanism
                     • bit 2: The client expects a push-reply and the server may send this reply without waiting for a push-request first.
                     • bit 3: The client is capable of doing key derivation using RFC5705 key material exporter.
                     • bit 4: The client is capable of accepting additional arguments to the AUTH_PENDING message.
              IV_NCP=2
                     Negotiable  ciphers,  client  supports  --cipher  pushed  by  the  server,  a  value of 2 or greater indicates client supports AES-GCM-128 and
                     AES-GCM-256.
              IV_CIPHERS=<ncp-ciphers>
                     The client announces the list of supported ciphers configured with the --data-ciphers option to the server.
              IV_GUI_VER=<gui_id> <version>
                     The UI version of a UI if one is running, for example de.blinkt.openvpn 0.5.47 for the Android app.
              IV_SSO=[crtext,][openurl,][proxy_url]
                     Additional authentication methods supported by the client.  This may be set by the client UI/GUI using --setenv
              When --push-peer-info is enabled the additional information consists of the following data:
              IV_HWADDR=<string>
                     This is intended to be a unique and persistent ID of the client.  The string value can be any readable ASCII string up to 64  bytes.   OpenVPN
                     2.x  and  some other implementations use the MAC address of the client's interface used to reach the default gateway. If this string is generated by the client, it should be consistent and preserved across independent session and preferably re-installations and upgrades.
              IV_SSL=<version string>
                     The ssl version used by the client, e.g.  OpenSSL 1.0.2f 28 Jan 2016.
              IV_PLAT_VER=x.y
                     The version of the operating system, e.g. 6.1 for Windows 7.
              UV_<name>=<value>
                     Client environment variables whose names start with UV_
       --remote args
              Remote host name or IP address, port and protocol.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 remote host
                 remote host port
                 remote host port proto
              The port and proto arguments are optional. The OpenVPN client will try to connect to a server at host:port.  The proto argument indicates the  protocol  to use when connecting with the remote, and may be tcp or udp.  To enforce IPv4 or IPv6 connections add a 4 or 6 suffix; like udp4 / udp6 / tcp4
              / tcp6.
              On the client, multiple --remote options may be specified for redundancy, each referring to a different OpenVPN server, in the order specified by the
              list of --remote options. Specifying multiple --remote options for this purpose is a special case of the more general connection-profile feature. See
              the <connection> documentation below.
              The client will move on to the next host in the list, in the event of connection failure. Note that at any given time, the  OpenVPN  client  will  at
              most be connected to one server.
              Examples:
                 remote server1.example.net
                 remote server1.example.net 1194
                 remote server2.example.net 1194 tcp
              Note:  Since UDP is connectionless, connection failure is defined by the --ping and --ping-restart options.
                     Also,  if  you  use multiple --remote options, AND you are dropping root privileges on the client with --user and/or --group AND the client is
                     running a non-Windows OS, if the client needs to switch to a different server, and that server pushes back different  TUN/TAP  or  route  settings,  the client may lack the necessary privileges to close and reopen the TUN/TAP interface. This could cause the client to exit with a fatal error.
              If --remote is unspecified, OpenVPN will listen for packets from any IP address, but will not act on those packets unless they pass  all  authentication  tests.  This requirement for authentication is binding on all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly trusted IP addresses (it is
              very easy to forge a source IP address on a UDP packet).
              When used in TCP mode, --remote will act as a filter, rejecting connections from any host which does not match host.
              If host is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses, OpenVPN will try them in the order that the system  getaddrinfo()  presents  them,  so
              priorization  and DNS randomization is done by the system library. Unless an IP version is forced by the protocol specification (4/6 suffix), OpenVPN
              will try both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in the order getaddrinfo() returns them.
       --remote-random
              When multiple --remote address/ports are specified, or if connection profiles are being used, initially randomize the order of the list as a kind  of
              basic load-balancing measure.
       --remote-random-hostname
              Prepend  a  random  string  (6  bytes,  12 hex characters) to hostname to prevent DNS caching. For example, "foo.bar.gov" would be modified to "<random-chars>.foo.bar.gov".
       --resolv-retry n
              If hostname resolve fails for --remote, retry resolve for n seconds before failing.
              Set n to "infinite" to retry indefinitely.
              By default, --resolv-retry infinite is enabled. You can disable by setting n=0.
       --single-session
              After initially connecting to a remote peer, disallow any new connections. Using this option means that a remote peer cannot connect, disconnect, and
              then reconnect.
              If the daemon is reset by a signal or --ping-restart, it will allow one new connection.
              --single-session can be used with --ping-exit or --inactive to create a single dynamic session that will exit when finished.
       --server-poll-timeout n
              When  connecting to a remote server do not wait for more than n seconds for a response before trying the next server. The default value is 120s. This
              timeout includes proxy and TCP connect timeouts.
       --static-challenge args
              Enable static challenge/response protocol
              Valid syntax:
                 static-challenge text echo
              The text challenge text is presented to the user which describes what information is requested.  The echo flag indicates if the user's  input  should
              be echoed on the screen.  Valid echo values are 0 or 1.
              See management-notes.txt in the OpenVPN distribution for a description of the OpenVPN challenge/response protocol.
       --show-proxy-settings
              Show sensed HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Currently, only Windows clients support this option.
       --http-proxy args
              Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy.  This requires at least an address server and port argument.  If HTTP Proxy-Authenticate is required, a
              file name to an authfile file containing a username and password on 2 lines can be given, or stdin to prompt from console. Its content  can  also  be
              specified in the config file with the --http-proxy-user-pass option. (See section on inline files)
              The last optional argument is an auth-method which should be one of none, basic, or ntlm.
              HTTP Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the auto or auto-nct flags (below).  This must replace the authfile argument.
              The  auto  flag  causes  OpenVPN to automatically determine the auth-method and query stdin or the management interface for username/password credentials, if required. This flag exists on OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.
              The auto-nct flag (no clear-text auth) instructs OpenVPN to automatically determine the authentication method, but to reject weak authentication protocols such as HTTP Basic Authentication.
              Examples:
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 authfile.txt
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 stdin
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 auto basic
                 http-proxy proxy.example.net 3128 auto-nct ntlm
       --http-proxy-option args
              Set extended HTTP proxy options. Requires an option type as argument and an optional parameter to the type.  Repeat to set multiple options.
              VERSION version
                     Set HTTP version number to version (default 1.0).
              AGENT user-agent
                     Set HTTP "User-Agent" string to user-agent.
              CUSTOM-HEADER name content
                     Adds the custom Header with name as name and content as the content of the custom HTTP header.
              Examples:
                 http-proxy-option VERSION 1.1
                 http-proxy-option AGENT OpenVPN/2.4
                 http-proxy-option X-Proxy-Flag some-flags
       --socks-proxy args
              Connect  to  remote  host through a Socks5 proxy.  A required server argument is needed.  Optionally a port (default 1080) and authfile can be given.
              The authfile is a file containing a username and password on 2 lines, or stdin can be used to prompt from console.
   Server Options
       Starting with OpenVPN 2.0, a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is supported, and can be enabled with the --mode server option. In server mode,  OpenVPN  will
       listen  on a single port for incoming client connections. All client connections will be routed through a single tun or tap interface. This mode is designed
       for scalability and should be able to support hundreds or even thousands of clients on sufficiently fast hardware. SSL/TLS authentication must  be  used  in
       this mode.
       --auth-gen-token args
              Returns an authentication token to successfully authenticated clients.
              Valid syntax:
                 auth-gen-token [lifetime] [external-auth]
              After  successful  user/password  authentication, the OpenVPN server will with this option generate a temporary authentication token and push that to
              the client. On the following renegotiations, the OpenVPN client will pass this token instead of the users password. On the  server  side  the  server
              will  do  the token authentication internally and it will NOT do any additional authentications against configured external user/password authentication mechanisms.
              The tokens implemented by this mechanism include an initial timestamp and a renew timestamp and are secured by HMAC.
              The lifetime argument defines how long the generated token is valid.  The lifetime is defined in seconds. If lifetime is not set or it is set  to  0,
              the token will never expire.
              The  token  will  expire either after the configured lifetime of the token is reached or after not being renewed for more than 2 * reneg-sec seconds.
              Clients will be sent renewed tokens on every TLS renogiation to keep the client's token updated. This is done to invalidate a token if  a  client  is
              disconnected for a sufficently long time, while at the same time permitting much longer token lifetimes for active clients.
              This  feature  is  useful for environments which are configured to use One Time Passwords (OTP) as part of the user/password authentications and that
              authentication mechanism does not implement any auth-token support.
              When the external-auth keyword is present the normal authentication method will always be called even if auth-token succeeds.  Normally other authentications method are skipped if auth-token verification suceeds or fails.
              This option postpones this decision to the external authentication methods and checks the validity of the account and do other checks.
              In  this  mode  the  environment  will  have  a  session_id variable that holds the session id from auth-gen-token. Also an environment variable session_state is present. This variable indicates whether the auth-token has succeeded or not. It can have the following values:
              Initial
                     No token from client.
              Authenticated
                     Token is valid and not expired.
              Expired
                     Token is valid but has expired.
              Invalid
                     Token is invalid (failed HMAC or wrong length)
              AuthenticatedEmptyUser / ExpiredEmptyUser
                     The token is not valid with the username sent from the client but would be valid (or expired) if we assume an empty username was used instead.
                     These  two  cases are a workaround for behaviour in OpenVPN 3.  If this workaround is not needed these two cases should be handled in the same
                     way as Invalid.
              Warning: Use this feature only if you want your authentication method called on every verification. Since the external authentication  is  called  it
              needs  to also indicate a success or failure of the authentication. It is strongly recommended to return an authentication failure in the case of the
              Invalid/Expired auth-token with the external-auth option unless the client could authenticate in another acceptable way  (e.g.  client  certificate),
              otherwise returning success will lead to authentication bypass (as does returning success on a wrong password from a script).
       --auth-gen-token-secret file
              Specifies  a  file that holds a secret for the HMAC used in --auth-gen-token If file is not present OpenVPN will generate a random secret on startup.
              This file should be used if auth-token should validate after restarting a server or if client should be able to roam between multiple OpenVPN servers
              with their auth-token.
       --auth-user-pass-optional
              Allow  connections by clients that do not specify a username/password.  Normally, when --auth-user-pass-verify or --management-client-auth are specified (or an authentication plugin module), the OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting clients to specify a username and password. This  option
              makes  the  submission of a username/password by clients optional, passing the responsibility to the user-defined authentication module/script to accept or deny the client based on other factors (such as the setting of X509 certificate fields).  When this option is used, and a  connecting  client
              does  not  submit a username/password, the user-defined authentication module/script will see the username and password as being set to empty strings
              (""). The authentication module/script MUST have logic to detect this condition and respond accordingly.
       --ccd-exclusive
              Require, as a condition of authentication, that a connecting client has a --client-config-dir file.
       --client-config-dir dir
              Specify a directory dir for custom client config files. After a connecting client has been authenticated, OpenVPN will look in this directory  for  a
              file having the same name as the client's X509 common name. If a matching file exists, it will be opened and parsed for client-specific configuration
              options. If no matching file is found, OpenVPN will instead try to open and parse a default file called "DEFAULT", which may be provided but  is  not
              required. Note that the configuration files must be readable by the OpenVPN process after it has dropped it's root privileges.
              This file can specify a fixed IP address for a given client using --ifconfig-push, as well as fixed subnets owned by the client using --iroute.
              One  of  the  useful  properties of this option is that it allows client configuration files to be conveniently created, edited, or removed while the
              server is live, without needing to restart the server.
              The following options are legal in a client-specific context: --push, --push-reset, --push-remove, --iroute, --ifconfig-push, --vlan-pvid and  --config.
       --client-to-client
              Because  the  OpenVPN  server mode handles multiple clients through a single tun or tap interface, it is effectively a router. The --client-to-client
              flag tells OpenVPN to internally route client-to-client traffic rather than pushing all client-originating traffic to the TUN/TAP interface.
              When this option is used, each client will "see" the other clients which are currently connected. Otherwise, each client will only  see  the  server.
              Don't use this option if you want to firewall tunnel traffic using custom, per-client rules.
       --disable
              Disable a particular client (based on the common name) from connecting.  Don't use this option to disable a client due to key or password compromise.
              Use a CRL (certificate revocation list) instead (see the --crl-verify option).
              This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must be specified either in a client instance config  file  using
              --client-config-dir or dynamically generated using a --client-connect script.
       --connect-freq args
              Allow a maximum of n new connections per sec seconds from clients.
              Valid syntax:
                 connect-freq n sec
              This  is  designed  to contain DoS attacks which flood the server with connection requests using certificates which will ultimately fail to authenticate.
              This is an imperfect solution however, because in a real DoS scenario, legitimate connections might also be refused.
              For the best protection against DoS attacks in server mode, use --proto udp and either --tls-auth or --tls-crypt.
       --duplicate-cn
              Allow multiple clients with the same common name to concurrently connect. In the absence of this option, OpenVPN will disconnect  a  client  instance
              upon connection of a new client having the same common name.
       --ifconfig-pool args
              Set aside a pool of subnets to be dynamically allocated to connecting clients, similar to a DHCP server.
              Valid syntax:
                 ifconfig-pool start-IP end-IP [netmask]
              For  tun-style  tunnels,  each  client will be given a /30 subnet (for interoperability with Windows clients).  For tap-style tunnels, individual addresses will be allocated, and the optional netmask parameter will also be pushed to clients.
       --ifconfig-ipv6-pool args
              Specify an IPv6 address pool for dynamic assignment to clients.
              Valid args:
                 ifconfig-ipv6-pool ipv6addr/bits
              The pool starts at ipv6addr and matches the offset determined from the start of the IPv4 pool.  If the host part of the given IPv6 address is 0,  the
              pool starts at ipv6addr +1.
       --ifconfig-pool-persist args
              Persist/unpersist ifconfig-pool data to file, at seconds intervals (default 600), as well as on program startup and shutdown.
              Valid syntax:
                 ifconfig-pool-persist file [seconds]
              The  goal  of this option is to provide a long-term association between clients (denoted by their common name) and the virtual IP address assigned to
              them from the ifconfig-pool. Maintaining a long-term association is good for clients because it allows them to effectively use the --persist-tun  option.
              file is a comma-delimited ASCII file, formatted as <Common-Name>,<IP-address>.
              If seconds = 0, file will be treated as read-only. This is useful if you would like to treat file as a configuration file.
              Note that the entries in this file are treated by OpenVPN as suggestions only, based on past associations between a common name and IP address.  They
              do not guarantee that the given common name will always receive the given IP address. If you want guaranteed assignment, use --ifconfig-push
       --ifconfig-push args
              Push virtual IP endpoints for client tunnel, overriding the --ifconfig-pool dynamic allocation.
              Valid syntax:
                 ifconfig-push local remote-netmask [alias]
              The parameters local and remote-netmask are set according to the --ifconfig directive which you want to execute on the client  machine  to  configure
              the  remote  end of the tunnel. Note that the parameters local and remote-netmask are from the perspective of the client, not the server. They may be
              DNS names rather than IP addresses, in which case they will be resolved on the server at the time of client connection.
              The optional alias parameter may be used in cases where NAT causes the client view of its local endpoint to differ from the server view. In this case
              local/remote-netmask will refer to the server view while alias/remote-netmask will refer to the client view.
              This  option  must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must be specified either in a client instance config file using
              --client-config-dir or dynamically generated using a --client-connect script.
              Remember also to include a --route directive in the main OpenVPN config file which encloses local, so that the kernel will know to route  it  to  the
              server's TUN/TAP interface.
              OpenVPN's internal client IP address selection algorithm works as follows:
              1. Use --client-connect script generated file for static IP (first choice).
              2. Use --client-config-dir file for static IP (next choice).
              3. Use --ifconfig-pool allocation for dynamic IP (last choice).
       --ifconfig-ipv6-push args
              for --client-config-dir per-client static IPv6 interface configuration, see --client-config-dir and --ifconfig-push for more details.
              Valid syntax:
                 ifconfig-ipv6-push ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote
       --inetd args
              Valid syntaxes:
                 inetd
                 inetd wait
                 inetd nowait
                 inetd wait progname
              Use this option when OpenVPN is being run from the inetd or xinetd(8) server.
              The wait and nowait option must match what is specified in the inetd/xinetd config file. The nowait mode can only be used with --proto tcp-server The
              default is wait.  The nowait mode can be used to instantiate the OpenVPN daemon as a classic TCP server, where client connection  requests  are  serviced    on    a    single    port    number.    For   additional   information   on   this   kind   of   configuration,   see   the   OpenVPN   FAQ:

              This option precludes the use of --daemon, --local or --remote.  Note that this option causes message and error output to be handled in the same  way
              as the --daemon option. The optional progname parameter is also handled exactly as in --daemon.
              Also note that in wait mode, each OpenVPN tunnel requires a separate TCP/UDP port and a separate inetd or xinetd entry. See the OpenVPN 1.x HOWTO for
              an example on using OpenVPN with xinetd: https://openvpn.net/community-resources/1xhowto/
       --multihome
              Configure a multi-homed UDP server. This option needs to be used when a server has more than one IP address (e.g. multiple interfaces,  or  secondary
              IP  addresses), and is not using --local to force binding to one specific address only. This option will add some extra lookups to the packet path to
              ensure that the UDP reply packets are always sent from the address that the client is talking to. This is not supported on all platforms, and it adds
              more processing, so it's not enabled by default.
              Notes:
                     • This option is only relevant for UDP servers.
                     • If  you  do an IPv6+IPv4 dual-stack bind on a Linux machine with multiple IPv4 address, connections to IPv4 addresses will not work right on
                       kernels before 3.15, due to missing kernel support for the IPv4-mapped case (some distributions have ported this to earlier kernel versions,
                       though).
       --iroute args
              Generate an internal route to a specific client. The netmask parameter, if omitted, defaults to 255.255.255.255.
              Valid syntax:
                 iroute network [netmask]
              This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet from the server to a particular client, regardless of where the client is connecting from.  Remember that you must also add the route to the system routing table as well (such as by using the --route directive). The  reason  why  two  routes  are
              needed  is  that  the  --route directive routes the packet from the kernel to OpenVPN. Once in OpenVPN, the --iroute directive routes to the specific
              client.
              This option must be specified either in a client instance config file using --client-config-dir or dynamically  generated  using  a  --client-connect
              script.
              The  --iroute directive also has an important interaction with --push "route ...". --iroute essentially defines a subnet which is owned by a particular client (we will call this client A). If you would like other clients to be able to reach A's subnet, you can use --push "route ..." together with
              --client-to-client  to  effect  this. In order for all clients to see A's subnet, OpenVPN must push this route to all clients EXCEPT for A, since the
              subnet is already owned by A. OpenVPN accomplishes this by not not pushing a route to a client if it matches one of the client's iroutes.
       --iroute-ipv6 args
              for --client-config-dir per-client static IPv6 route configuration, see --iroute for more details how to setup and use this,  and  how  --iroute  and
              --route interact.
              Valid syntax:
                 iroute-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
       --max-clients n
              Limit server to a maximum of n concurrent clients.
       --max-routes-per-client n
              Allow  a maximum of n internal routes per client (default 256). This is designed to help contain DoS attacks where an authenticated client floods the
              server with packets appearing to come from many unique MAC addresses, forcing the server to deplete virtual memory as its internal routing table  expands.  This  directive  can  be used in a --client-config-dir file or auto-generated by a --client-connect script to override the global value for a
              particular client.
              Note that this directive affects OpenVPN's internal routing table, not the kernel routing table.
       --opt-verify
              Clients that connect with options that are incompatible with those of the server will be disconnected.
              Options that will be compared for compatibility include dev-type, link-mtu, tun-mtu, proto, ifconfig, comp-lzo, fragment, keydir, cipher, auth,  keysize, secret, no-replay, tls-auth, key-method, tls-server and tls-client.
              This option requires that --disable-occ NOT be used.
       --port-share args
              Share OpenVPN TCP with another service
              Valid syntax:
                 port-share host port [dir]
              When  run  in  TCP  server mode, share the OpenVPN port with another application, such as an HTTPS server. If OpenVPN senses a connection to its port
              which is using a non-OpenVPN protocol, it will proxy the connection to the server at host:port. Currently only  designed  to  work  with  HTTP/HTTPS,
              though it would be theoretically possible to extend to other protocols such as ssh.
              dir  specifies an optional directory where a temporary file with name N containing content C will be dynamically generated for each proxy connection,
              where N is the source IP:port of the client connection and C is the source IP:port of the connection to the proxy receiver.  This  directory  can  be
              used  as  a  dictionary  by  the proxy receiver to determine the origin of the connection. Each generated file will be automatically deleted when the
              proxied connection is torn down.
              Not implemented on Windows.
       --push option
              Push a config file option back to the client for remote execution. Note that option must be enclosed in double quotes (""). The client  must  specify
              --pull in its config file. The set of options which can be pushed is limited by both feasibility and security. Some options such as those which would
              execute scripts are banned, since they would effectively allow a compromised server to execute arbitrary code on the client. Other  options  such  as
              TLS or MTU parameters cannot be pushed because the client needs to know them before the connection to the server can be initiated.
              This  is a partial list of options which can currently be pushed: --route, --route-gateway, --route-delay, --redirect-gateway, --ip-win32, --dhcp-option, --inactive, --ping, --ping-exit, --ping-restart, --setenv, --auth-token,  --persist-key,  --persist-tun,  --echo,  --comp-lzo,  --socket-flags,
              --sndbuf, --rcvbuf
       --push-remove opt
              Selectively remove all --push options matching "opt" from the option list for a client. opt is matched as a substring against the whole option string
              to-be-pushed to the client, so --push-remove route would remove all --push route ... and  --push  route-ipv6  ...   statements,  while  --push-remove
              "route-ipv6 2001:" would only remove IPv6 routes for 2001:... networks.
              --push-remove  can  only be used in a client-specific context, like in a --client-config-dir file, or --client-connect script or plugin -- similar to
              --push-reset, just more selective.
              NOTE: to change an option, --push-remove can be used to first remove the old value, and then add a new --push option with the new value.
              NOTE 2: due to implementation details, 'ifconfig' and 'ifconfig-ipv6' can only be removed with an exact match on the option ( push-remove  ifconfig),
              no substring matching and no matching on the IPv4/IPv6 address argument is possible.
       --push-reset
              Don't  inherit  the  global  push list for a specific client instance.  Specify this option in a client-specific context such as with a --client-config-dir configuration file. This option will ignore --push options at the global config file level.
              NOTE: --push-reset is very thorough: it will remove almost all options from the list of to-be-pushed options.  In many cases, some of  these  options
              will  need  to  be re-configured afterwards - specifically, --topology subnet and --route-gateway will get lost and this will break client configs in
              many cases.  Thus, for most purposes, --push-remove is better suited to selectively remove push options for individual clients.
       --server args
              A helper directive designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode. This directive will set up an OpenVPN server which will  allocate
              addresses  to  clients  out  of the given network/netmask. The server itself will take the .1 address of the given network for use as the server-side
              endpoint of the local TUN/TAP interface. If the optional nopool flag is given, no dynamic IP address pool will prepared for VPN clients.
              Valid syntax:
                 server network netmask [nopool]
              For example, --server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 expands as follows:
                 mode server
                 tls-server
                 push "topology [topology]"
                 if dev tun AND (topology == net30 OR topology == p2p):
                   ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
                   if !nopool:
                     ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.4 10.8.0.251
                   route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
                   if client-to-client:
                     push "route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0"
                   else if topology == net30:
                     push "route 10.8.0.1"
                 if dev tap OR (dev tun AND topology == subnet):
                   ifconfig 10.8.0.1 255.255.255.0
                   if !nopool:
                     ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.253 255.255.255.0
                   push "route-gateway 10.8.0.1"
                   if route-gateway unset:
                     route-gateway 10.8.0.2
              Don't use --server if you are ethernet bridging. Use --server-bridge instead.
       --server-bridge args
              A helper directive similar to --server which is designed to simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's server mode in ethernet bridging configurations.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 server-bridge gateway netmask pool-start-IP pool-end-IP
                 server-bridge [nogw]
              If --server-bridge is used without any parameters, it will enable a DHCP-proxy mode, where connecting OpenVPN clients will receive an IP address  for
              their  TAP adapter from the DHCP server running on the OpenVPN server-side LAN. Note that only clients that support the binding of a DHCP client with
              the TAP adapter (such as Windows) can support this mode. The optional nogw flag (advanced) indicates that gateway information should not be pushed to
              the client.
              To  configure  ethernet  bridging, you must first use your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet NIC interface.  For
              example, on Linux this is done with the brctl tool, and with Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections Panel by selecting the ethernet and TAP
              adapters and right-clicking on "Bridge Connections".
              Next  you  you  must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge interface.  The gateway and netmask parameters to --server-bridge can be set to either
              the IP/netmask of the bridge interface, or the IP/netmask of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.
              Finally, set aside a IP range in the bridged subnet, denoted by pool-start-IP and pool-end-IP, for OpenVPN to allocate to connecting clients.
              For example, server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 expands as follows:
                 mode server
                 tls-server
                 ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
                 push "route-gateway 10.8.0.4"
              In another example, --server-bridge (without parameters) expands as follows:
                 mode server
                 tls-server
                 push "route-gateway dhcp"
              Or --server-bridge nogw expands as follows:
                 mode server
                 tls-server
       --server-ipv6 args
              Convenience-function to enable a number of IPv6 related options at once, namely --ifconfig-ipv6, --ifconfig-ipv6-pool and --push tun-ipv6.
              Valid syntax:
                 server-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
              Pushing of the --tun-ipv6 directive is done for older clients which require an explicit --tun-ipv6 in their configuration.
       --stale-routes-check args
              Remove routes which haven't had activity for n seconds (i.e. the ageing time).  This check is run every t seconds (i.e. check interval).
              Valid syntax:
                 stale-routes-check n [t]
              If t is not present it defaults to n.
              This option helps to keep the dynamic routing table small. See also --max-routes-per-client
       --username-as-common-name
              Use the authenticated username as  the  common-name,  rather  than  the  common-name  from  the  client  certificate.  Requires  that  some  form  of
              --auth-user-pass  verification  is  in effect. As the replacement happens after --auth-user-pass verification, the verification script or plugin will
              still receive the common-name from the certificate.
              The common_name environment variable passed to scripts and plugins invoked after authentication (e.g, client-connect script) and file names parsed in
              client-config directory will match the username.
       --verify-client-cert mode
              Specify whether the client is required to supply a valid certificate.
              Possible mode options are:
              none   A  client  certificate  is  not required. the client needs to authenticate using username/password only. Be aware that using this directive is
                     less secure than requiring certificates from all clients.
                     If you use this directive, the entire responsibility of authentication will rest on your --auth-user-pass-verify script, so keep in mind  that
                     bugs in your script could potentially compromise the security of your VPN.
                     --verify-client-cert none is functionally equivalent to --client-cert-not-required.
              optional
                     A  client may present a certificate but it is not required to do so.  When using this directive, you should also use a --auth-user-pass-verify
                     script to ensure that clients are authenticated using a certificate, a username and password, or possibly even both.
                     Again, the entire responsibility of authentication will rest on your --auth-user-pass-verify script, so keep in mind that bugs in your  script
                     could potentially compromise the security of your VPN.
              require
                     This is the default option. A client is required to present a certificate, otherwise VPN access is refused.
              If  you don't use this directive (or use --verify-client-cert require) but you also specify an --auth-user-pass-verify script, then OpenVPN will perform double authentication. The client certificate verification AND the --auth-user-pass-verify script will need to succeed in order for a client  to
              be authenticated and accepted onto the VPN.
       --vlan-tagging
              Server-only option. Turns the OpenVPN server instance into a switch that understands VLAN-tagging, based on IEEE 802.1Q.
              The  server  TAP  device and each of the connecting clients is seen as a port of the switch. All client ports are in untagged mode and the server TAP
              device is VLAN-tagged, untagged or accepts both, depending on the --vlan-accept setting.
              Ethernet frames with a prepended 802.1Q tag are called "tagged". If the VLAN Identifier (VID) field in such a tag is non-zero, the  frame  is  called
              "VLAN-tagged".  If  the VID is zero, but the Priority Control Point (PCP) field is non-zero, the frame is called "prio-tagged". If there is no 802.1Q
              tag, the frame is "untagged".
              Using the --vlan-pvid v option once per client (see --client-config-dir), each port can be associated with a certain VID.  Packets can only  be  forwarded  between  ports  having  the  same  VID.   Therefore,  clients  with  differing  VIDs  are  completely  separated  from  one-another,  even if
              --client-to-client is activated.
              The packet filtering takes place in the OpenVPN server. Clients should not have any VLAN tagging configuration applied.
              The --vlan-tagging option is off by default. While turned off, OpenVPN accepts any Ethernet frame and does not perform  any  special  processing  for
              VLAN-tagged packets.
              This option can only be activated in --dev tap mode.
       --vlan-accept args
              Configure the VLAN tagging policy for the server TAP device.
              Valid syntax:
                 vlan-accept  all|tagged|untagged
              The following modes are available:
              tagged Admit  only VLAN-tagged frames. Only VLAN-tagged packets are accepted, while untagged or priority-tagged packets are dropped when entering the
                     server TAP device.
              untagged
                     Admit only untagged and prio-tagged frames.  VLAN-tagged packets are not accepted, while untagged  or  priority-tagged  packets  entering  the
                     server TAP device are tagged with the value configured for the global --vlan-pvid setting.
              all (default)
                     Admit all frames.  All packets are admitted and then treated like untagged or tagged mode respectively.
              Note:  Some vendors refer to switch ports running in tagged mode as "trunk ports" and switch ports running in untagged mode as "access ports".
              Packets  forwarded  from  clients to the server are VLAN-tagged with the originating client's PVID, unless the VID matches the global --vlan-pvid, in
              which case the tag is removed.
              If no PVID is configured for a given client (see --vlan-pvid) packets are tagged with 1 by default.
       --vlan-pvid v
              Specifies which VLAN identifier a "port" is associated with. Only valid when --vlan-tagging is speficied.
              In the client context, the setting specifies which VLAN ID a client is associated with. In the global context, the VLAN ID of the server  TAP  device
              is set. The latter only makes sense for --vlan-accept untagged and --vlan-accept all modes.
              Valid  values for v go from 1 through to 4094. The global value defaults to 1. If no --vlan-pvid is specified in the client context, the global value
              is inherited.
              In some switch implementations, the PVID is also referred to as "Native VLAN".
ENCRYPTION OPTIONS
   SSL Library information
       --show-ciphers
              (Standalone) Show all cipher algorithms to use with the --cipher option.
       --show-digests
              (Standalone) Show all message digest algorithms to use with the --auth option.
       --show-tls
              (Standalone) Show all TLS ciphers supported by the crypto library.  OpenVPN uses TLS to secure the control channel, over which the keys that are used
              to protect the actual VPN traffic are exchanged. The TLS ciphers will be sorted from highest preference (most secure) to lowest.
              Be aware that whether a cipher suite in this list can actually work depends on the specific setup of both peers (e.g. both peers must support the cipher, and an ECDSA cipher suite will not work if you are using an RSA certificate, etc.).
       --show-engines
              (Standalone) Show currently available hardware-based crypto acceleration engines supported by the OpenSSL library.
       --show-groups
              (Standalone) Show all available elliptic curves/groups to use with the --ecdh-curve and tls-groups options.
   Generating key material
       --genkey args
              (Standalone) Generate a key to be used of the type keytype. if keyfile is left out or empty the key will be output on stdout. See the following  sections for the different keytypes.
              Valid syntax:
                 --genkey keytype keyfile
              Valid keytype arguments are:
              secret                Standard OpenVPN shared secret keys
              tls-crypt             Alias for secret

              • Generating Shared Secret Keys Generate a shared secret, for use with the --secret, --tls-auth or --tls-crypt options.
                Syntax:
                   $ openvpn --genkey secret|tls-crypt|tls-auth keyfile
                The  key is saved in keyfile. All three variants (--secret, tls-crypt and tls-auth) generate the same type of key. The aliases are added for convenience.
                If using this for --secret, this file must be shared with the peer over a pre-existing secure channel such as scp(1).
              • Generating TLS Crypt v2 Server key Generate a --tls-crypt-v2 key to be used by an OpenVPN server.  The key is stored in keyfile.
                Syntax:
                   --genkey tls-crypt-v2-server keyfile
              • Generating TLS Crypt v2 Client key Generate a --tls-crypt-v2 key to be used by OpenVPN clients.  The key is stored in keyfile.
                Syntax
                   --genkey tls-crypt-v2-client keyfile [metadata]
                If supplied, include the supplied metadata in the wrapped client key. This metadata must be supplied in base64-encoded form. The metadata  must  be
                at most 735 bytes long (980 bytes in base64).
                If  no  metadata  is supplied, OpenVPN will use a 64-bit unix timestamp representing the current time in UTC, encoded in network order, as metadata
                for the generated key.
                A tls-crypt-v2 client key is wrapped using a server key. To generate a client key, the  user  must  therefore  supply  the  server  key  using  the
                --tls-crypt-v2 option.
                Servers can use --tls-crypt-v2-verify to specify a metadata verification command.
              • Generate Authentication Token key Generate a new secret that can be used with --auth-gen-token-secret
                Syntax:
                   --genkey auth-token [keyfile]
                Note:  This  file  should be kept secret to the server as anyone that has access to this file will be able to generate auth tokens that the OpenVPN
                       server will accept as valid.
   Data Channel Renegotiation
       When running OpenVPN in client/server mode, the data channel will use a separate ephemeral encryption key which is rotated at regular intervals.
       --reneg-bytes n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n bytes sent or received (disabled by default with an exception, see below). OpenVPN allows the lifetime of a  key
              to  be  expressed as a number of bytes encrypted/decrypted, a number of packets, or a number of seconds. A key renegotiation will be forced if any of
              these three criteria are met by either peer.
              If using ciphers with cipher block sizes less than 128-bits, --reneg-bytes is set to 64MB by default, unless it is explicitly disabled by setting the
              value to 0, but this is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED as this is designed to add some protection against the SWEET32 attack vector. For more information see the
              --cipher option.
       --reneg-pkts n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n packets sent and received (disabled by default).
       --reneg-sec args
              Renegotiate data channel key after at most max seconds (default 3600) and at least min seconds (default is 90% of max for servers, and equal  to  max
              for clients).
                 reneg-sec max [min]
              The effective --reneg-sec value used is per session pseudo-uniform-randomized between min and max.
              With  the  default  value  of  3600 this results in an effective per session value in the range of 3240 .. 3600 seconds for servers, or just 3600 for
              clients.
              When using dual-factor authentication, note that this default value may cause the end user to be challenged to reauthorize once per hour.
              Also, keep in mind that this option can be used on both the client and server, and whichever uses the lower value will be  the  one  to  trigger  the
              renegotiation.  A  common  mistake  is to set --reneg-sec to a higher value on either the client or server, while the other side of the connection is
              still using the default value of 3600 seconds, meaning that the renegotiation will still occur once per 3600 seconds. The  solution  is  to  increase
              --reneg-sec on both the client and server, or set it to 0 on one side of the connection (to disable), and to your chosen value on the other side.
   TLS Mode Options
       TLS  mode  is  the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and flexibility. TLS mode works by establishing control and data channels which are
       multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port. OpenVPN initiates a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher and HMAC keys to protect the
       data channel. TLS mode uses a robust reliability layer over the UDP connection for all control channel communication, while the data channel, over which encrypted tunnel data passes, is forwarded without any mediation. The result is the best of both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over UDP with  only
       the  overhead  of encrypt, decrypt, and HMAC functions, and a control channel that provides all of the security features of TLS, including certificate-based
       authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.
       To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local certificate/key pair (--cert and --key), signed by  the  root  certificate  which  is
       specified in --ca.
       When  two  OpenVPN  peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the other. Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a certificate
       which was signed by the master root certificate as specified in --ca.
       If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will succeed, both OpenVPN peers will exchange temporary session keys, and  the  tunnel  will
       begin passing data.
       The OpenVPN project provides a set of scripts for managing RSA certificates and keys: https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa
       --askpass file
              Get certificate password from console or file before we daemonize.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 askpass
                 askpass file
              For  the  extremely  security conscious, it is possible to protect your private key with a password. Of course this means that every time the OpenVPN
              daemon is started you must be there to type the password. The --askpass option allows you to start OpenVPN from the command line.  It will query  you
              for a password before it daemonizes. To protect a private key with a password you should omit the -nodes option when you use the openssl command line
              tool to manage certificates and private keys.
              If file is specified, read the password from the first line of file. Keep in mind that storing your password in a file to a  certain  extent  invalidates the extra security provided by using an encrypted key.
       --ca file
              Certificate  authority  (CA)  file in .pem format, also referred to as the root certificate. This file can have multiple certificates in .pem format,
              concatenated together. You can construct your own certificate authority certificate and private key by using a command such as:
                 openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
              Then edit your openssl.cnf file and edit the certificate variable to point to your new root certificate ca.crt.
              For testing purposes only, the OpenVPN distribution includes a sample CA certificate (ca.crt). Of course you should never use the  test  certificates
              and  test keys distributed with OpenVPN in a production environment, since by virtue of the fact that they are distributed with OpenVPN, they are totally insecure.
       --capath dir
              Directory containing trusted certificates (CAs and CRLs). Not available with mbed TLS.
              CAs in the capath directory are expected to be named <hash>.<n>. CRLs are expected to be named <hash>.r<n>. See the -CApath option of openssl verify,
              and the -hash option of openssl x509, openssl crl and X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir()(3) for more information.
              Similar  to  the --crl-verify option, CRLs are not mandatory - OpenVPN will log the usual warning in the logs if the relevant CRL is missing, but the
              connection will be allowed.
       --cert file
              Local peer's signed certificate in .pem format -- must be signed by a certificate authority whose certificate is in --ca file. Each peer in an  OpenVPN  link  running in TLS mode should have its own certificate and private key file. In addition, each certificate should have been signed by the key
              of a certificate authority whose public key resides in the --ca certificate authority file. You can easily make your own certificate  authority  (see
              above) or pay money to use a commercial service such as thawte.com (in which case you will be helping to finance the world's second space tourist :).
              To generate a certificate, you can use a command such as:
                 openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr
              If your certificate authority private key lives on another machine, copy the certificate signing request (mycert.csr) to this other machine (this can
              be done over an insecure channel such as email). Now sign the certificate with a command such as:
                 openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr
              Now  copy  the  certificate  (mycert.crt)  back to the peer which initially generated the .csr file (this can be over a public medium). Note that the
              openssl ca command reads the location of the certificate authority key from its configuration file such as /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf  --  note  also
              that for certificate authority functions, you must set up the files index.txt (may be empty) and serial (initialize to 01).
       --crl-verify args
              Check peer certificate against a Certificate Revocation List.
              Valid syntax:
                 crl-verify file/directory flag
              Examples:
                 crl-verify crl-file.pem
                 crl-verify /etc/openvpn/crls dir
              A CRL (certificate revocation list) is used when a particular key is compromised but when the overall PKI is still intact.
              Suppose  you  had  a PKI consisting of a CA, root certificate, and a number of client certificates. Suppose a laptop computer containing a client key
              and certificate was stolen. By adding the stolen certificate to the CRL file, you could reject any connection which attempts to use  it,  while  preserving the overall integrity of the PKI.
              The only time when it would be necessary to rebuild the entire PKI from scratch would be if the root certificate key itself was compromised.
              The option is not mandatory - if the relevant CRL is missing, OpenVPN will log a warning in the logs - e.g.
                 VERIFY WARNING: depth=0, unable to get certificate CRL
              but  the  connection  will be allowed.  If the optional dir flag is specified, enable a different mode where the crl-verify is pointed at a directory
              containing files named as revoked serial numbers (the files may be empty, the contents are never read). If a client requests a connection, where  the
              client certificate serial number (decimal string) is the name of a file present in the directory, it will be rejected.
              Note:  As  the  crl file (or directory) is read every time a peer connects, if you are dropping root privileges with --user, make sure that this user
                     has sufficient privileges to read the file.
       --dh file
              File containing Diffie Hellman parameters in .pem format (required for --tls-server only).
              Set file to none to disable Diffie Hellman key exchange (and use ECDH only). Note that this requires peers to be using an SSL library  that  supports
              ECDH TLS cipher suites (e.g. OpenSSL 1.0.1+, or mbed TLS 2.0+).
              Use openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048 to generate 2048-bit DH parameters. Diffie Hellman parameters may be considered public.
       --ecdh-curve name
              Specify  the curve to use for elliptic curve Diffie Hellman. Available curves can be listed with --show-curves. The specified curve will only be used
              for ECDH TLS-ciphers.
              This option is not supported in mbed TLS builds of OpenVPN.
       --extra-certs file
              Specify a file containing one or more PEM certs (concatenated together) that complete the local certificate chain.
              This option is useful for "split" CAs, where the CA for server certs is different than the CA for client certs. Putting certs  in  this  file  allows
              them  to  be used to complete the local certificate chain without trusting them to verify the peer-submitted certificate, as would be the case if the
              certs were placed in the ca file.
       --hand-window n
              Handshake Window -- the TLS-based key exchange must finalize within n seconds of handshake initiation by any peer (default 60 seconds). If the  handshake  fails we will attempt to reset our connection with our peer and try again. Even in the event of handshake failure we will still use our expiring key for up to --tran-window seconds to maintain continuity of transmission of tunnel data.
       --key file
              Local peer's private key in .pem format. Use the private key which was generated when you built your peer's certificate (see --cert file above).
       --pkcs12 file
              Specify a PKCS #12 file containing local private key, local certificate, and root CA certificate. This option can be used instead  of  --ca,  --cert,
              and --key.  Not available with mbed TLS.
       --remote-cert-eku oid
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit extended key usage.
              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the host they connect to is a designated server.
              The extended key usage should be encoded in oid notation, or OpenSSL symbolic representation.
       --remote-cert-ku key-usage
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit key-usage.
              If  present in the certificate, the keyUsage value is validated by the TLS library during the TLS handshake. Specifying this option without arguments
              requires this extension to be present (so the TLS library will verify it).
              If key-usage is a list of usage bits, the keyUsage field must have at least the same bits set as the bits in  one  of  the  values  supplied  in  the
              key-usage list.
              The key-usage values in the list must be encoded in hex, e.g.
                 remote-cert-ku a0
       --remote-cert-tls type
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit key usage and extended key usage based on RFC3280 TLS rules.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 remote-cert-tls server
                 remote-cert-tls client
              This  is  a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the host they connect to is a designated server. Or the other way around; for a server
              to verify that only hosts with a client certificate can connect.
              The --remote-cert-tls client option is equivalent to
                 remote-cert-ku
                 remote-cert-eku "TLS Web Client Authentication"
              The --remote-cert-tls server option is equivalent to
                 remote-cert-ku
                 remote-cert-eku "TLS Web Server Authentication"
              This is an important security precaution to protect against a man-in-the-middle attack where an authorized client  attempts  to  connect  to  another
              client  by  impersonating  the  server.  The  attack  is  easily  prevented  by  having  clients verify the server certificate using any one of --remote-cert-tls, --verify-x509-name, or --tls-verify.
       --tls-auth args
              Add an additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS control channel to mitigate DoS attacks and attacks on the TLS stack.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 tls-auth file
                 tls-auth file 0
                 tls-auth file 1
              In a nutshell, --tls-auth enables a kind of "HMAC firewall" on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port, where TLS control channel packets bearing  an  incorrect  HMAC
              signature can be dropped immediately without response.
              file (required) is a file in OpenVPN static key format which can be generated by --genkey.
              Older versions (up to OpenVPN 2.3) supported a freeform passphrase file.  This is no longer supported in newer versions (v2.4+).
              See the --secret option for more information on the optional direction parameter.
              --tls-auth  is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode where it is listening for packets from any IP address, such as when --remote is not
              specified, or --remote is specified with --float.
              The rationale for this feature is as follows. TLS requires a multi-packet exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer. During this time  before
              authentication,  OpenVPN  is  allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer. The potential peer is also exposing many parts of OpenVPN
              and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending. Most successful network attacks today seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such  as  buffer
              overflow  attacks) or force a program to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable. Of course the first line of defense is always to produce
              clean, well-audited code. OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top priority. But as history has shown,  many  of  the
              most widely used network applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.
              So  as  a  second  line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on the
              control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against  DoS  (Denial of Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a potential, but
              as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.
              --tls-auth does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the  TLS  level  has
              had  a  chance  to  authenticate the peer. The result is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception, before
              they have a chance to consume additional system resources such as by initiating a TLS handshake. --tls-auth can be strengthened by adding  the  --replay-persist option which will keep OpenVPN's replay protection state in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.
              It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the key file used with --tls-auth gives a peer nothing more than the power to initiate
              a TLS handshake. It is not used to encrypt or authenticate any tunnel data.
              Use --tls-crypt instead if you want to use the key file to not only authenticate, but also encrypt the TLS control channel.
       --tls-groups list
              A list of allowable groups/curves in order of preference.
              Set the allowed elliptic curves/groups for the TLS session.  These groups are allowed to be used in signatures and key exchange.
              mbedTLS currently allows all known curves per default.
              OpenSSL 1.1+ restricts the list per default to
                 "X25519:secp256r1:X448:secp521r1:secp384r1".
              If you use certificates that use non-standard curves, you might need to add them here. If you do not force the ecdh curve by using --ecdh-curve,  the
              groups for ecdh will also be picked from this list.
              OpenVPN maps the curve name secp256r1 to prime256v1 to allow specifying the same tls-groups option for mbedTLS and OpenSSL.
              Warning:  this option not only affects elliptic curve certificates but also the key exchange in TLS 1.3 and using this option improperly will disable
              TLS 1.3.
       --tls-cert-profile profile
              Set the allowed cryptographic algorithms for certificates according to profile.
              The following profiles are supported:
              legacy (default)
                     SHA1 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.
              preferred
                     SHA2 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.
              suiteb SHA256/SHA384, ECDSA with P-256 or P-384.
              This option is only fully supported for mbed TLS builds. OpenSSL builds use the following approximation:
              legacy (default)
                     sets "security level 1"
              preferred
                     sets "security level 2"
              suiteb sets "security level 3" and --tls-cipher "SUITEB128".
              OpenVPN will migrate to 'preferred' as default in the future. Please ensure that your keys already comply.
       WARNING: --tls-ciphers, --tls-ciphersuites and tls-groups
              These options are expert features, which - if used correctly - can improve the security of your VPN connection. But it is also  easy  to  unwittingly
              use them to carefully align a gun with your foot, or just break your connection. Use with care!
       --tls-cipher l
              A list l of allowable TLS ciphers delimited by a colon (":").
              These  setting can be used to ensure that certain cipher suites are used (or not used) for the TLS connection. OpenVPN uses TLS to secure the control
              channel, over which the keys that are used to protect the actual VPN traffic are exchanged.
              The supplied list of ciphers is (after potential OpenSSL/IANA name translation) simply supplied to the crypto library. Please see the OpenSSL  and/or
              mbed TLS documentation for details on the cipher list interpretation.
              For OpenSSL, the --tls-cipher is used for TLS 1.2 and below.
              Use --show-tls to see a list of TLS ciphers supported by your crypto library.
              The     default     for    --tls-cipher    is    to    use    mbed    TLS's    default    cipher    list    when    using    mbed    TLS    or    DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!kDH:!kECDH:!DSS:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA when using OpenSSL.
       --tls-ciphersuites l
              Same as --tls-cipher but for TLS 1.3 and up. mbed TLS has no TLS 1.3 support yet and only the --tls-cipher setting is used.
              The default for --tls-ciphersuites is to use the crypto library's default.
       --tls-client
              Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake.
       --tls-crypt keyfile
              Encrypt and authenticate all control channel packets with the key from keyfile. (See --tls-auth for more background.)
              Encrypting (and authenticating) control channel packets:
              • provides more privacy by hiding the certificate used for the TLS connection,
              • makes it harder to identify OpenVPN traffic as such,
              • provides "poor-man's" post-quantum security, against attackers who will never know the pre-shared key (i.e. no forward secrecy).
              In contrast to --tls-auth, --tls-crypt does not require the user to set --key-direction.
              Security Considerations
              All peers use the same --tls-crypt pre-shared group key to authenticate and encrypt control channel messages. To ensure that IV collisions remain unlikely,  this  key should not be used to encrypt more than 2^48 client-to-server or 2^48 server-to-client control channel messages. A typical initial
              negotiation is about 10 packets in each direction. Assuming both initial negotiation and renegotiations are at most 2^16 (65536) packets (to be  conservative),  and (re)negotiations happen each minute for each user (24/7), this limits the tls-crypt key lifetime to 8171 years divided by the number
              of users. So a setup with 1000 users should rotate the key at least once each eight years. (And a setup with 8000 users each year.)
              If IV collisions were to occur, this could result in the security of --tls-crypt degrading to the same security as using --tls-auth.   That  is,  the
              control channel still benefits from the extra protection against active man-in-the-middle-attacks and DoS attacks, but may no longer offer extra privacy and post-quantum security on top of what TLS itself offers.
              For large setups or setups where clients are not trusted, consider using --tls-crypt-v2 instead. That uses per-client unique keys,  and  thereby  improves the bounds to 'rotate a client key at least once per 8000 years'.
       --tls-crypt-v2 keyfile
              Use client-specific tls-crypt keys.
              For clients, keyfile is a client-specific tls-crypt key. Such a key can be generated using the --genkey tls-crypt-v2-client option.
              For servers, keyfile is used to unwrap client-specific keys supplied by the client during connection setup. This key must be the same as the key used
              to generate the client-specific key (see --genkey tls-crypt-v2-client).
              On servers, this option can be used together with the --tls-auth or --tls-crypt option. In that case, the server will detect whether  the  client  is
              using client-specific keys, and automatically select the right mode.
       --tls-crypt-v2-verify cmd
              Run  command  cmd  to verify the metadata of the client-specific tls-crypt-v2 key of a connecting client. This allows server administrators to reject
              client connections, before exposing the TLS stack (including the notoriously dangerous X.509 and ASN.1 stacks) to the connecting client.
              OpenVPN supplies the following environment variables to the command:
              • script_type is set to tls-crypt-v2-verify
              • metadata_type is set to 0 if the metadata was user supplied, or 1 if it's a 64-bit unix timestamp representing the key creation time.
              • metadata_file contains the filename of a temporary file that contains the client metadata.
              The command can reject the connection by exiting with a non-zero exit code.
       --tls-exit
              Exit on TLS negotiation failure.
       --tls-export-cert directory
              Store the certificates the clients use upon connection to this directory. This will be done before --tls-verify is called. The certificates will  use
              a  temporary name and will be deleted when the tls-verify script returns. The file name used for the certificate is available via the peer_cert environment variable.
       --tls-server
              Enable TLS and assume server role during TLS handshake. Note that OpenVPN is designed as a peer-to-peer application. The  designation  of  client  or
              server is only for the purpose of negotiating the TLS control channel.
       --tls-timeout n
              Packet  retransmit  timeout on TLS control channel if no acknowledgment from remote within n seconds (default 2). When OpenVPN sends a control packet
              to its peer, it will expect to receive an acknowledgement within n seconds or it will retransmit the packet, subject to a TCP-like exponential  backoff  algorithm.  This  parameter only applies to control channel packets. Data channel packets (which carry encrypted tunnel data) are never acknowledged, sequenced, or retransmitted by OpenVPN because the higher level network protocols running on top of the tunnel such as TCP expect this role to
              be left to them.
       --tls-version-min args
              Sets the minimum TLS version we will accept from the peer (default is "1.0").
              Valid syntax:
                 tls-version-min version ['or-highest']
              Examples  for version include 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. If or-highest is specified and version is not recognized, we will only accept the highest TLS version
              supported by the local SSL implementation.
       --tls-version-max version
              Set the maximum TLS version we will use (default is the highest version supported). Examples for version include 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2.
       --verify-hash args
              Specify SHA1 or SHA256 fingerprint for level-1 cert.
              Valid syntax:
                 verify-hash hash [algo]
              The level-1 cert is the CA (or intermediate cert) that signs the leaf certificate, and is one removed from the leaf certificate in the  direction  of
              the root. When accepting a connection from a peer, the level-1 cert fingerprint must match hash or certificate verification will fail. Hash is specified as XX:XX:... For example:
                 AD:B0:95:D8:09:C8:36:45:12:A9:89:C8:90:09:CB:13:72:A6:AD:16
              The algo flag can be either SHA1 or SHA256. If not provided, it defaults to SHA1.
       --verify-x509-name args
              Accept connections only if a host's X.509 name is equal to name. The remote host must also pass all other tests of verification.
              Valid syntax:
                 verify-x509 name type
              Which X.509 name is compared to name depends on the setting of type.  type can be subject to match the complete subject DN (default), name to match a
              subject  RDN or name-prefix to match a subject RDN prefix. Which RDN is verified as name depends on the --x509-username-field option. But it defaults
              to the common name (CN), e.g. a certificate with a subject DN
                 C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1
              would be matched by:
                 verify-x509-name 'C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1'
                 verify-x509-name Server-1 name
                 verify-x509-name Server- name-prefix
              The last example is useful if you want a client to only accept connections to Server-1, Server-2, etc.
              --verify-x509-name is a useful replacement for the --tls-verify option to verify the remote host, because --verify-x509-name works in a --chroot  environment without any dependencies.
              Using  a  name prefix is a useful alternative to managing a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) on the client, since it allows the client to refuse all
              certificates except for those associated with designated servers.
              NOTE:  Test against a name prefix only when you are using OpenVPN with a custom CA certificate that is under your control. Never use this option with
                     type name-prefix when your client certificates are signed by a third party, such as a commercial web CA.
       --x509-track attribute
              Save  peer  X509  attribute  value in environment for use by plugins and management interface. Prepend a + to attribute to save values from full cert
              chain. Values will be encoded as X509_<depth>_<attribute>=<value>. Multiple --x509-track options can be defined to track multiple attributes.
       --x509-username-field args
              Field in the X.509 certificate subject to be used as the username (default CN).
              Valid syntax:
                 x509-username-field [ext:]fieldname
              Typically, this option is specified with fieldname as either of the following:
                 x509-username-field emailAddress
                 x509-username-field ext:subjectAltName
              The first example uses the value of the emailAddress attribute in the certificate's Subject field as the username. The second example uses  the  ext:
              prefix  to signify that the X.509 extension fieldname subjectAltName be searched for an rfc822Name (email) field to be used as the username. In cases
              where there are multiple email addresses in ext:fieldname, the last occurrence is chosen.
              When this option is used, the --verify-x509-name option will match against the chosen fieldname instead of the Common Name.
              Only the subjectAltName and issuerAltName X.509 extensions are supported.
              Please note: This option has a feature which will convert an all-lowercase fieldname to uppercase characters, e.g., ou -> OU. A mixed-case  fieldname
              or one having the ext: prefix will be left as-is. This automatic upcasing feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
   PKCS#11 / SmartCard options
       --pkcs11-cert-private args
              Set if access to certificate object should be performed after login.  Every provider has its own setting.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 pkcs11-cert-private 0
                 pkcs11-cert-private 1
       --pkcs11-id name
              Specify the serialized certificate id to be used. The id can be gotten by the standalone --show-pkcs11-ids option.
       --pkcs11-id-management
              Acquire  PKCS#11  id  from management interface. In this case a NEED-STR 'pkcs11-id-request' real-time message will be triggered, application may use
              pkcs11-id-count command to retrieve available number of certificates, and pkcs11-id-get command to retrieve certificate id and certificate body.
       --pkcs11-pin-cache seconds
              Specify how many seconds the PIN can be cached, the default is until the token is removed.
       --pkcs11-private-mode mode
              Specify which method to use in order to perform private key operations.  A different mode can be specified for each provider. Mode is encoded as  hex
              number, and can be a mask one of the following:
              0 (default)   Try to determine automatically.
              1             Use sign.
              2             Use sign recover.
              4             Use decrypt.
              8             Use unwrap.
       --pkcs11-protected-authentication args
              Use PKCS#11 protected authentication path, useful for biometric and external keypad devices. Every provider has its own setting.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 pkcs11-protected-authentication 0
                 pkcs11-protected-authentication 1
       --pkcs11-providers provider
              Specify  an  RSA  Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki) providers to load. This option can be used instead of --cert, --key
              and --pkcs12.
              If p11-kit is present on the system, its p11-kit-proxy.so module will be loaded by default if either the --pkcs11-id  or  --pkcs11-id-management  options are specified without --pkcs11-provider being given.
       --show-pkcs11-ids args
              (Standalone) Show PKCS#11 token object list.
              Valid syntax:
                 show-pkcs11 [provider] [cert_private]
              Specify cert_private as 1 if certificates are stored as private objects.
              If p11-kit is present on the system, the provider argument is optional; if omitted the default p11-kit-proxy.so module will be queried.
              --verb option can be used BEFORE this option to produce debugging information.
DATA CHANNEL CIPHER NEGOTIATION
       OpenVPN  2.4  and higher have the capability to negotiate the data cipher that is used to encrypt data packets. This section describes the mechanism in more
       detail and the different backwards compatibility mechanism with older server and clients.
   OpenVPN 2.5 and higher behaviour
       When both client and server are at least running OpenVPN 2.5, that the order of the ciphers of the server's --data-ciphers is used to pick the the data  cipher.   That means that the first cipher in that list that is also in the client's --data-ciphers list is chosen. If no common cipher is found the client is
       rejected with a AUTH_FAILED message (as seen in client log):
          AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED,Data channel cipher negotiation failed (no shared cipher)
       OpenVPN 2.5 will only allow the ciphers specified in --data-ciphers. To ensure backwards compatibility also if a cipher is specified using the --cipher  option it is automatically added to this list. If both options are unset the default is AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM.
   OpenVPN 2.4 clients
       The  negotiation  support  in OpenVPN 2.4 was the first iteration of the implementation and still had some quirks. Its main goal was "upgrade to AES-256-GCM
       when possible".  An OpenVPN 2.4 client that is built against a crypto library that supports AES in GCM mode and does not have --ncp-disable will always  announce support for AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM to a server by sending IV_NCP=2.
       This  only  causes a problem if --ncp-ciphers option has been changed from the default of AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM to a value that does not include these two
       ciphers. When a OpenVPN servers try to use AES-256-GCM or AES-128-GCM the connection will then  fail.  It  is  therefore  recommended  to  always  have  the
       AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM ciphers to the --ncp-ciphers options to avoid this behaviour.
   OpenVPN 3 clients
       Clients  based  on the OpenVPN 3.x library (https://github.com/openvpn/openvpn3/) do not have a configurable --ncp-ciphers or --data-ciphers option. Instead
       these clients will announce support for all their supported AEAD ciphers (AES-256-GCM, AES-128-GCM and in newer versions also Chacha20-Poly1305).
       To support OpenVPN 3.x based clients at least one of these ciphers needs to be included in the server's --data-ciphers option.
   OpenVPN 2.3 and older clients (and clients with --ncp-disable)
       When a client without cipher negotiation support connects to a server the cipher specified with the --cipher option in the client configuration must be  included  in  the --data-ciphers option of the server to allow the client to connect. Otherwise the client will be sent the AUTH_FAILED message that indicates
       no shared cipher.
       If the client is 2.3 or older and has been configured with the --enable-small  ./configure argument, using data-ciphers-fallback cipher in the server config
       file with the explicit cipher used by the client is necessary.
   OpenVPN 2.4 server
       When a client indicates support for AES-128-GCM and AES-256-GCM (with IV_NCP=2) an OpenVPN 2.4 server will send the first cipher of the --ncp-ciphers to the
       OpenVPN client regardless of what the cipher is. To emulate the behaviour of an OpenVPN 2.4 client as close as possible and have compatibility  to  a  setup
       that  depends  on  this  quirk,  adding   AES-128-GCM and AES-256-GCM to the client's --data-ciphers option is required. OpenVPN 2.5+ will only announce the
       IV_NCP=2 flag if those ciphers are present.
   OpenVPN 2.3 and older servers (and servers with --ncp-disable)
       The cipher used by the server must be included in --data-ciphers to allow the client connecting to a server without cipher negotiation support.   (For  compatibility OpenVPN 2.5 will also accept the cipher set with --cipher)
       If  the server is 2.3 or older and  has been configured with the --enable-small ./configure argument, adding data-ciphers-fallback cipher to the client config with the explicit cipher used by the server is necessary.
   Blowfish in CBC mode (BF-CBC) deprecation
       The --cipher option defaulted to BF-CBC in OpenVPN 2.4 and older version. The default was never changed to ensure backwards compatibility.  In  OpenVPN  2.5
       this  behaviour has now been changed so that if the --cipher is not explicitly set it does not allow the weak BF-CBC cipher any more and needs to explicitly
       added as --cipher BFC-CBC or added to --data-ciphers.
       We strongly recommend to switching away from BF-CBC to a more secure cipher as soon as possible instead.
NETWORK CONFIGURATION
       OpenVPN consists of two sides of network configuration.  One side is the link between the local and remote side, the  other  side  is  the  virtual  network
       adapter (tun/tap device).
   Link Options
       This link options section covers options related to the connection between the local and the remote host.
       --bind keywords
              Bind to local address and port. This is the default unless any of --proto tcp-client , --http-proxy or --socks-proxy are used.
              If the optional ipv6only keyword is present OpenVPN will bind only to IPv6 (as opposed to IPv6 and IPv4) when a IPv6 socket is opened.
       --float
              Allow remote peer to change its IP address and/or port number, such as due to DHCP (this is the default if --remote is not used).  --float when specified with --remote allows an OpenVPN session to initially connect to a peer at a known address, however if packets arrive from  a  new  address  and
              pass  all  authentication tests, the new address will take control of the session. This is useful when you are connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address such as a dial-in user or DHCP client.
              Essentially, --float tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets from any address, not only the address which was specified in the --remote option.
       --fragment max
              Enable internal datagram fragmentation so that no UDP datagrams are sent which are larger than max bytes.
              The max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu parameter, i.e. the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead  has  been  added
              in, but not including the UDP header itself.
              The --fragment option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol (--proto udp).
              --fragment adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.
              See the --mssfix option below for an important related option to --fragment.
              It should also be noted that this option is not meant to replace UDP fragmentation at the IP stack level. It is only meant as a last resort when path
              MTU discovery is broken. Using this option is less efficient than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link and using native  IP  fragmentation  instead.
              Having  said  that,  there are circumstances where using OpenVPN's internal fragmentation capability may be your only option, such as tunneling a UDP
              multicast stream which requires fragmentation.
       --keepalive args
              A helper directive designed to simplify the expression of --ping and --ping-restart.
              Valid syntax:
                 keepalive interval timeout
              This option can be used on both client and server side, but it is enough to add this on the server side  as  it  will  push  appropriate  --ping  and
              --ping-restart options to the client. If used on both server and client, the values pushed from server will override the client local values.
              The  timeout  argument  will be twice as long on the server side. This ensures that a timeout is detected on client side before the server side drops
              the connection.
              For example, --keepalive 10 60 expands as follows:
                 if mode server:
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 120           # Argument: timeout*2
                     push "ping 10"             # Argument: interval
                     push "ping-restart 60"     # Argument: timeout
                 else
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 60            # Argument: timeout
       --link-mtu n
              Sets an upper bound on the size of UDP packets which are sent between OpenVPN peers. It's best not to set this parameter unless you know what  you're
              doing.
       --local host
              Local host name or IP address for bind. If specified, OpenVPN will bind to this address only. If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all interfaces.
       --lport port
              Set local TCP/UDP port number or name. Cannot be used together with --nobind option.
       --mark value
              Mark  encrypted  packets being sent with value. The mark value can be matched in policy routing and packetfilter rules. This option is only supported
              in Linux and does nothing on other operating systems.
       --mode m
              Set OpenVPN major mode. By default, OpenVPN runs in point-to-point mode (p2p). OpenVPN  2.0  introduces  a  new  mode  (server)  which  implements  a
              multi-client server capability.
       --mssfix max
              Announce  to  TCP  sessions running over the tunnel that they should limit their send packet sizes such that after OpenVPN has encapsulated them, the
              resulting UDP packet size that OpenVPN sends to its peer will not exceed max bytes. The default value is 1450.
              The max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu parameter, i.e. the UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead  has  been  added
              in,  but  not  including the UDP header itself.  Resulting packet would be at most 28 bytes larger for IPv4 and 48 bytes for IPv6 (20/40 bytes for IP
              header and 8 bytes for UDP header). Default value of 1450 allows IPv4 packets to be transmitted over a link with MTU 1473 or higher without IP  level
              fragmentation.
              The --mssfix option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol for OpenVPN peer-to-peer communication, i.e. --proto udp.
              --mssfix  and  --fragment can be ideally used together, where --mssfix will try to keep TCP from needing packet fragmentation in the first place, and
              if big packets come through anyhow (from protocols other than TCP), --fragment will internally fragment them.
              Both --fragment and --mssfix are designed to work around cases where Path MTU discovery is broken on the network path between OpenVPN peers.
              The usual symptom of such a breakdown is an OpenVPN connection which successfully starts, but then stalls during active usage.
              If --fragment and --mssfix are used together, --mssfix will take its default max parameter from the --fragment max option.
              Therefore, one could lower the maximum UDP packet size to 1300 (a good first try for solving MTU-related connection problems) with the following  options:
                 --tun-mtu 1500 --fragment 1300 --mssfix
       --mtu-disc type
              Should we do Path MTU discovery on TCP/UDP channel? Only supported on OSes such as Linux that supports the necessary system call to set.
              Valid types:
              no      Never send DF (Don't Fragment) frames
              maybe   Use per-route hints
              yes     Always DF (Don't Fragment)
       --mtu-test
              To empirically measure MTU on connection startup, add the --mtu-test option to your configuration. OpenVPN will send ping packets of various sizes to
              the remote peer and measure the largest packets which were successfully received. The --mtu-test process normally takes about 3 minutes to complete.
       --nobind
              Do not bind to local address and port. The IP stack will allocate a dynamic port for returning packets. Since the value of the dynamic port could not
              be known in advance by a peer, this option is only suitable for peers which will be initiating connections by using the --remote option.
       --passtos
              Set the TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload's TOS is.
       --ping n
              Ping  remote over the TCP/UDP control channel if no packets have been sent for at least n seconds (specify --ping on both peers to cause ping packets
              to be sent in both directions since OpenVPN ping packets are not echoed like IP ping packets). When used in one  of  OpenVPN's  secure  modes  (where
              --secret, --tls-server or --tls-client is specified), the ping packet will be cryptographically secure.
              This option has two intended uses:
              1. Compatibility  with  stateful firewalls. The periodic ping will ensure that a stateful firewall rule which allows OpenVPN UDP packets to pass will
                 not time out.
              2. To provide a basis for the remote to test the existence of its peer using the --ping-exit option.
       --ping-exit n
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after n seconds pass without reception of a ping or other packet from remote. This option can  be  combined  with  --inactive,
              --ping and --ping-exit to create a two-tiered inactivity disconnect.
              For example,
                 openvpn [options...] --inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60
              when  used  on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60 seconds if its peer disconnects, but will exit after one hour if no actual tunnel data
              is exchanged.
       --ping-restart n
              Similar to --ping-exit, but trigger a SIGUSR1 restart after n seconds pass without reception of a ping or other packet from remote.
              This option is useful in cases where the remote peer has a dynamic IP address and a low-TTL DNS name is used to track the IP address using a  service
              such as https://www.nsupdate.info/ + a dynamic DNS client such as ddclient.
              If  the  peer  cannot  be  reached, a restart will be triggered, causing the hostname used with --remote to be re-resolved (if --resolv-retry is also
              specified).
              In server mode, --ping-restart, --inactive or any other type of internally generated signal will always be applied to individual client instance  objects,  never  to whole server itself. Note also in server mode that any internally generated signal which would normally cause a restart, will cause
              the deletion of the client instance object instead.
              In client mode, the --ping-restart parameter is set to 120 seconds by default. This default will hold until the client pulls a replacement value from
              the server, based on the --keepalive setting in the server configuration. To disable the 120 second default, set --ping-restart 0 on the client.
              See the signals section below for more information on SIGUSR1.
              Note that the behavior of SIGUSR1 can be modified by the --persist-tun, --persist-key, --persist-local-ip and --persist-remote-ip options.
              Also note that --ping-exit and --ping-restart are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together.
       --ping-timer-rem
              Run  the  --ping-exit  /  --ping-restart  timer only if we have a remote address. Use this option if you are starting the daemon in listen mode (i.e.
              without an explicit --remote peer), and you don't want to start clocking timeouts until a remote peer connects.
       --proto p
              Use protocol p for communicating with remote host. p can be udp, tcp-client, or tcp-server.
              The default protocol is udp when --proto is not specified.
              For UDP operation, --proto udp should be specified on both peers.
              For TCP operation, one peer must use --proto tcp-server and the other must use --proto tcp-client. A peer started with tcp-server will  wait  indefinitely  for  an  incoming connection. A peer started with tcp-client will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable
              via the --connect-retry option) and try again infinite or up to N retries (adjustable via the --connect-retry-max option). Both TCP client and server
              will simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connection.
              OpenVPN  is  designed  to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is provided for situations where UDP cannot be used. In comparison with UDP,
              TCP will usually be somewhat less efficient and less robust when used over unreliable or congested networks.
              This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP: http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html
              There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous from a security and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or  application-level UDP protocols, or tunneling protocols which don't possess a built-in reliability layer.
       --port port
              TCP/UDP  port number or port name for both local and remote (sets both --lport and --rport options to given port). The current default of 1194 represents the official IANA port number assignment for OpenVPN and has been used since version 2.0-beta17. Previous versions used port 5000  as  the  default.
       --rport port
              Set TCP/UDP port number or name used by the --remote option. The port can also be set directly using the --remote option.
       --replay-window args
              Modify the replay protection sliding-window size and time window.
              Valid syntax:
                 replay-window n [t]
              Use a replay protection sliding-window of size n and a time window of t seconds.
              By default n is 64 (the IPSec default) and t is 15 seconds.
              This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e. when either --proto udp is specified, or no --proto option is specified.
              When  OpenVPN  tunnels  IP  packets over UDP, there is the possibility that packets might be dropped or delivered out of order. Because OpenVPN, like
              IPSec, is emulating the physical network layer, it will accept an out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such packets in the same order  they
              were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they satisfy several constraints.
              a. The packet cannot be a replay (unless --no-replay is specified, which disables replay protection altogether).
              b. If  a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if the difference between its sequence number and the highest sequence number received
                 so far is less than n.
              c. If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it arrives no later than t seconds after any packet  containing  a  higher  sequence
                 number.
              If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want to use a larger value
              for n. Satellite links in particular often require this.
              If you run OpenVPN at --verb 4, you will see the message "Replay-window backtrack occurred [x]" every time the maximum sequence number backtrack seen
              thus far increases. This can be used to calibrate n.
              There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet reordering at the security layer.
              Namely,  to  what extent should the security layer protect the encapsulated protocol from attacks which masquerade as the kinds of normal packet loss
              and reordering that occur over IP networks?
              The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a certain fixed sequence number window.
              OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well as sequence space.
              OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in which case OpenVPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards  message  deletion
              and reordering: Don't allow it. Since TCP guarantees reliability, any packet loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an attack.
              In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred when tunneling non-IP or UDP application protocols which might be vulnerable
              to a message deletion or reordering attack which falls within the normal operational parameters of IP networks.
              So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be  vulnerable  to  a  message  deletion  or  reordering attack that falls within the normal operating parameters of what is to be expected from the physical IP
              layer. The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as the VPN transport layer.
       --replay-persist file
              Persist replay-protection state across sessions using file to save and reload the state.
              This option will strengthen protection against replay attacks, especially when you are using OpenVPN in a dynamic context (such as with --inetd) when
              OpenVPN sessions are frequently started and stopped.
              This option will keep a disk copy of the current replay protection state (i.e. the most recent packet timestamp and sequence number received from the
              remote peer), so that if an OpenVPN session is stopped and restarted, it will reject any replays of packets which were already received by the  prior
              session.
              This  option  only makes sense when replay protection is enabled (the default) and you are using either --secret (shared-secret key mode) or TLS mode
              with --tls-auth.
       --socket-flags flags
              Apply the given flags to the OpenVPN transport socket. Currently, only TCP_NODELAY is supported.
              The TCP_NODELAY socket flag is useful in TCP mode, and causes the kernel to send tunnel packets immediately over the TCP connection without trying to
              group several smaller packets into a larger packet.  This can result in a considerably improvement in latency.
              This option is pushable from server to client, and should be used on both client and server for maximum effect.
       --tcp-nodelay
              This  macro  sets the TCP_NODELAY socket flag on the server as well as pushes it to connecting clients. The TCP_NODELAY flag disables the Nagle algorithm on TCP sockets causing packets to be transmitted immediately with low latency, rather than waiting a short period of time in order to aggregate
              several packets into a larger containing packet.  In VPN applications over TCP, TCP_NODELAY is generally a good latency optimization.
              The macro expands as follows:
                 if mode server:
                     socket-flags TCP_NODELAY
                     push "socket-flags TCP_NODELAY"
   Virtual Network Adapter (VPN interface)
       Options in this section relates to configuration of the virtual tun/tap network interface, including setting the VPN IP address and network routing.
       --bind-dev device
              (Linux only) Set device to bind the server socket to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding device
       --block-ipv6
              On  the  client,  instead  of  sending  IPv6  packets over the VPN tunnel, all IPv6 packets are answered with an ICMPv6 no route host message. On the
              server, all IPv6 packets from clients are answered with an ICMPv6 no route to host message. This options is intended for cases when  IPv6  should  be
              blocked and other options are not available. --block-ipv6 will use the remote IPv6 as source address of the ICMPv6 packets if set, otherwise will use
              fe80::7 as source address.
              For this option to make sense you actually have to route traffic to the tun interface. The following example config block would send all IPv6 traffic
              to  OpenVPN  and  answer  all  requests with no route to host, effectively blocking IPv6 (to avoid IPv6 connections from dual-stacked clients leaking
              around IPv4-only VPN services).
              Client config
                        --ifconfig-ipv6 fd15:53b6:dead::2/64 fd15:53b6:dead::1
                        --redirect-gateway ipv6
                        --block-ipv6
              Server config
                     Push a "valid" ipv6 config to the client and block on the server
                        --push "ifconfig-ipv6 fd15:53b6:dead::2/64 fd15:53b6:dead::1"
                        --push "redirect-gateway ipv6"
                        --block-ipv6
              Note: this option does not influence traffic sent from the server towards the client (neither on the server nor on the client  side).   This  is  not
              seen as necessary, as such traffic can be most easily avoided by not configuring IPv6 on the server tun, or setting up a server-side firewall rule.
       --dev device
              TUN/TAP virtual network device which can be tunX, tapX, null or an arbitrary name string (X can be omitted for a dynamic device.)
              See examples section below for an example on setting up a TUN device.
              You must use either tun devices on both ends of the connection or tap devices on both ends. You cannot mix them, as they represent different underlying network layers:
              tun    devices encapsulate IPv4 or IPv6 (OSI Layer 3)
              tap    devices encapsulate Ethernet 802.3 (OSI Layer 2).
              Valid syntaxes:
                 dev tun2
                 dev tap4
                 dev ovpn
              When the device name starts with tun or tap, the device type is extracted automatically.  Otherwise the --dev-type option needs to be added as well.
       --dev-node node
              Explicitly set the device node rather than using /dev/net/tun, /dev/tun, /dev/tap, etc. If OpenVPN cannot figure out whether node is a TUN or TAP device based on the name, you should also specify --dev-type tun or --dev-type tap.
              Under  Mac OS X this option can be used to specify the default tun implementation. Using --dev-node utun forces usage of the native Darwin tun kernel
              support. Use --dev-node utunN to select a specific utun instance. To force using the tun.kext (/dev/tunX) use --dev-node tun. When not  specifying  a
              --dev-node option openvpn will first try to open utun, and fall back to tun.kext.
              On Windows systems, select the TAP-Win32 adapter which is named node in the Network Connections Control Panel or the raw GUID of the adapter enclosed
              by braces. The --show-adapters option under Windows can also be used to enumerate all available TAP-Win32 adapters and will  show  both  the  network
              connections control panel name and the GUID for each TAP-Win32 adapter.
       --dev-type device-type
              Which  device  type  are we using? device-type should be tun (OSI Layer 3) or tap (OSI Layer 2). Use this option only if the TUN/TAP device used with
              --dev does not begin with tun or tap.
       --dhcp-option args
              Set additional network parameters on supported platforms. May be specified on the client or pushed from the server. On Windows these options are handled  by the tap-windows6 driver by default or directly by OpenVPN if dhcp is disabled or the wintun driver is in use. The OpenVPN for Android client
              also handles them internally.
              On all other platforms these options are only saved in the client's environment under the name foreign_option_{n} before the --up script is called. A
              plugin  or an --up script must be used to pick up and interpret these as required. Many Linux distributions include such scripts and some third-party
              user interfaces such as tunnelblick also come with scripts that process these options.
              Valid syntax:
                 dhcp-options type [parm]
              DOMAIN name
                     Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix to name.
              ADAPTER_DOMAIN_SUFFIX name
                     Alias to DOMAIN. This is a compatibility option, it should not be used in new deployments.
              DOMAIN-SEARCH name
                     Add name to the domain search list.  Repeat this option to add more entries. Up to 10 domains are supported.
              DNS address
                     Set primary domain name server IPv4 or IPv6 address.  Repeat this option to set secondary DNS server addresses.
                     Note: DNS IPv6 servers are currently set using netsh (the existing DHCP code can only do IPv4 DHCP, and that protocol only  permits  IPv4  addresses anywhere). The option will be put into the environment, so an --up script could act upon it if needed.
              WINS address
                     Set primary WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server).  Repeat this option to set secondary WINS server addresses.
              NBDD address
                     Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server). Repeat this option to set secondary NBDD server addresses.
              NTP address
                     Set primary NTP server address (Network Time Protocol).  Repeat this option to set secondary NTP server addresses.
              NBT type
                     Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type. Possible options:
                     1      b-node (broadcasts)
                     2      p-node (point-to-point name queries to a WINS server)
                     4      m-node (broadcast then query name server)
                     8      h-node (query name server, then broadcast).
              NBS scope-id
                     Set  NetBIOS  over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as NBT) module. The
                     primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on a single network to only those nodes with the same  NetBIOS  scope  ID.
                     The  NetBIOS  scope  ID  is  a character string that is appended to the NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts must match, or the two
                     hosts will not be able to communicate.  The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows computers to use the same computer name, as they have different scope
                     IDs.  The  Scope  ID  becomes  a  part  of  the  NetBIOS  name,  making  the  name  unique.  (This  description  of NetBIOS scopes courtesy of
                     NeonSurge@abyss.com)
              DISABLE-NBT
                     Disable Netbios-over-TCP/IP.
       --ifconfig args
              Set TUN/TAP adapter parameters. It requires the IP address of the local VPN endpoint. For TUN devices in point-to-point mode, the next argument  must
              be the VPN IP address of the remote VPN endpoint. For TAP devices, or TUN devices used with --topology subnet, the second argument is the subnet mask
              of the virtual network segment which is being created or connected to.
              For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual point-to-point IP connections (when used in --topology net30 or p2p mode), the proper usage  of  --ifconfig
              is to use two private IP addresses which are not a member of any existing subnet which is in use. The IP addresses may be consecutive and should have
              their order reversed on the remote peer.  After the VPN is established, by pinging rn, you will be pinging across the VPN.
              For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet segments, or TUN devices in --topology subnet mode (which create virtual  "multipoint networks"), --ifconfig is used to set an IP address and subnet mask just as a physical ethernet adapter would be similarly configured. If you
              are attempting to connect to a remote ethernet bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set to values which would be valid on the the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP can be used for the same purpose).
              This option, while primarily a proxy for the ifconfig(8) command, is designed to simplify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by providing a standard interface to the different ifconfig implementations on different platforms.
              --ifconfig parameters which are IP addresses can also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts file resolvable name.
              For TAP devices, --ifconfig should not be used if the TAP interface will be getting an IP address lease from a DHCP server.
              Examples:
                 # tun device in net30/p2p mode
                 ifconfig 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.1
                 # tun/tap device in subnet mode
                 ifconfig 10.8.0.2 255.255.255.0
       --ifconfig-ipv6 args
              Configure an IPv6 address on the tun device.
              Valid syntax:
                 ifconfig-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [ipv6remote]
              The ipv6addr/bits argument is the IPv6 address to use. The second parameter is used as route target for --route-ipv6 if no gateway is specified.
              The --topology option has no influence with --ifconfig-ipv6
       --ifconfig-noexec
              Don't actually execute ifconfig/netsh commands, instead pass --ifconfig parameters to scripts using environmental variables.
       --ifconfig-nowarn
              Don't output an options consistency check warning if the --ifconfig option on this side of the connection doesn't match the  remote  side.   This  is
              useful  when you want to retain the overall benefits of the options consistency check (also see --disable-occ option) while only disabling the ifconfig component of the check.
              For example, if you have a configuration where the local host uses --ifconfig but the remote host does not, use --ifconfig-nowarn on the local host.
              This option will also silence warnings about potential address conflicts which occasionally annoy more experienced users by triggering  "false  positive" warnings.
       --lladdr address
              Specify the link layer address, more commonly known as the MAC address.  Only applied to TAP devices.
       --persist-tun
              Don't close and reopen TUN/TAP device or run up/down scripts across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.
              SIGUSR1 is a restart signal similar to SIGHUP, but which offers finer-grained control over reset options.
       --redirect-gateway flags
              Automatically execute routing commands to cause all outgoing IP traffic to be redirected over the VPN. This is a client-side option.
              This option performs three steps:
              1. Create  a  static  route  for  the --remote address which forwards to the pre-existing default gateway. This is done so that (3) will not create a
                 routing loop.
              2. Delete the default gateway route.
              3. Set the new default gateway to be the VPN endpoint address (derived either from --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig  when  --dev
                 tun is specified).
              When the tunnel is torn down, all of the above steps are reversed so that the original default route is restored.
              Option flags:
              local  Add the local flag if both OpenVPN peers are directly connected via a common subnet, such as with wireless. The local flag will cause step (1)
                     above to be omitted.
              autolocal
                     Try to automatically determine whether to enable local flag above.
              def1   Use this flag to override the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 rather than 0.0.0.0/0. This has the benefit of overriding but
                     not wiping out the original default gateway.
              bypass-dhcp
                     Add  a  direct  route to the DHCP server (if it is non-local) which bypasses the tunnel (Available on Windows clients, may not be available on
                     non-Windows clients).
              bypass-dns
                     Add a direct route to the DNS server(s) (if they are non-local) which bypasses the tunnel (Available on Windows clients, may not be  available
                     on non-Windows clients).
              block-local
                     Block  access to local LAN when the tunnel is active, except for the LAN gateway itself. This is accomplished by routing the local LAN (except
                     for the LAN gateway address) into the tunnel.
              ipv6   Redirect IPv6 routing into the tunnel. This works similar to the def1 flag, that is, more specific IPv6 routes are added (2000::/4, 3000::/4),
                     covering the whole IPv6 unicast space.
              !ipv4  Do not redirect IPv4 traffic - typically used in the flag pair ipv6 !ipv4 to redirect IPv6-only.
       --redirect-private flags
              Like --redirect-gateway, but omit actually changing the default gateway.  Useful when pushing private subnets.
       --route args
              Add route to routing table after connection is established. Multiple routes can be specified. Routes will be automatically torn down in reverse order
              prior to TUN/TAP device close.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 route network/IP
                 route network/IP netmask
                 route network/IP netmask gateway
                 route network/IP netmask gateway metric
              This option is intended as a convenience proxy for the route(8) shell command, while at the same time providing portable semantics  across  OpenVPN's
              platform space.
              netmask
                     defaults to 255.255.255.255 when not given
              gateway
                     default taken from --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified.
              metric default taken from --route-metric if set, otherwise 0.
              The default can be specified by leaving an option blank or setting it to default.
              The network and gateway parameters can also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts file resolvable name, or as one of three special keywords:
              vpn_gateway
                     The remote VPN endpoint address (derived either from --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified).
              net_gateway
                     The pre-existing IP default gateway, read from the routing table (not supported on all OSes).
              remote_host
                     The --remote address if OpenVPN is being run in client mode, and is undefined in server mode.
       --route-delay args
              Valid syntaxes:
                 route-delay
                 route-delay n
                 route-delay n m
              Delay  n seconds (default 0) after connection establishment, before adding routes. If n is 0, routes will be added immediately upon connection establishment. If --route-delay is omitted, routes will be added immediately after TUN/TAP device open and --up script execution,  before  any  --user  or
              --group privilege downgrade (or --chroot execution.)
              This  option  is  designed  to be useful in scenarios where DHCP is used to set tap adapter addresses. The delay will give the DHCP handshake time to
              complete before routes are added.
              On Windows, --route-delay tries to be more intelligent by waiting w seconds (default 30 by default) for the  TAP-Win32  adapter  to  come  up  before
              adding routes.
       --route-ipv6 args
              Setup IPv6 routing in the system to send the specified IPv6 network into OpenVPN's tun.
              Valid syntax:
                 route-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [gateway] [metric]
              The  gateway  parameter  is  only  used  for  IPv6  routes  across  tap  devices,  and  if  missing,  the  ipv6remote  field  from --ifconfig-ipv6 or
              --route-ipv6-gateway is used.
       --route-gateway arg
              Specify a default gateway for use with --route.
              If dhcp is specified as the parameter, the gateway address will be extracted from a DHCP negotiation with the OpenVPN server-side LAN.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 route-gateway gateway
                 route-gateway dhcp
       --route-ipv6-gateway gw
              Specify a default gateway gw for use with --route-ipv6.
       --route-metric m
              Specify a default metric m for use with --route.
       --route-noexec
              Don't add or remove routes automatically. Instead pass routes to --route-up script using environmental variables.
       --route-nopull
              When used with --client or --pull, accept options pushed by server EXCEPT for routes, block-outside-dns and dhcp options like DNS servers.
              When used on the client, this option effectively bars the server from adding routes to the client's routing table,  however  note  that  this  option
              still allows the server to set the TCP/IP properties of the client's TUN/TAP interface.
       --topology mode
              Configure  virtual  addressing  topology  when running in --dev tun mode. This directive has no meaning in --dev tap mode, which always uses a subnet
              topology.
              If you set this directive on the server, the --server and --server-bridge directives will automatically push your chosen topology setting to  clients
              as well. This directive can also be manually pushed to clients. Like the --dev directive, this directive must always be compatible between client and
              server.
              mode can be one of:
              net30  Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 subnet per client. This is designed to allow point-to-point semantics when some or all of
                     the connecting clients might be Windows systems. This is the default on OpenVPN 2.0.
              p2p    Use  a point-to-point topology where the remote endpoint of the client's tun interface always points to the local endpoint of the server's tun
                     interface. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client. Only use when none of the connecting clients are Windows systems.
              subnet Use a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by configuring the tun interface with a local IP address and subnet mask,  similar  to  the
                     topology  used  in --dev tap and ethernet bridging mode. This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting client and works on Windows as
                     well. Only available when server and clients are OpenVPN 2.1 or higher, or OpenVPN 2.0.x which has been manually patched with  the  --topology
                     directive  code. When used on Windows, requires version 8.2 or higher of the TAP-Win32 driver. When used on *nix, requires that the tun driver
                     supports an ifconfig(8) command which sets a subnet instead of a remote endpoint IP address.
              Note: Using --topology subnet changes the interpretation of the arguments of --ifconfig to mean "address netmask", no longer "local remote".
       --tun-mtu n
              Take the TUN device MTU to be n and derive the link MTU from it (default 1500). In most cases, you will probably want to leave this parameter set  to
              its default value.
              The MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) is the maximum datagram size in bytes that can be sent unfragmented over a particular network path.  OpenVPN requires that packets on the control and data channels be sent unfragmented.
              MTU problems often manifest themselves as connections which hang during periods of active usage.
              It's best to use the --fragment and/or --mssfix options to deal with MTU sizing issues.
       --tun-mtu-extra n
              Assume that the TUN/TAP device might return as many as n bytes more than the --tun-mtu size on read. This parameter defaults to 0,  which  is  sufficient  for most TUN devices. TAP devices may introduce additional overhead in excess of the MTU size, and a setting of 32 is the default when TAP devices are used. This parameter only controls internal OpenVPN buffer sizing, so there is no transmission overhead  associated  with  using  a  larger
              value.
   TUN/TAP standalone operations
       These two standalone operations will require --dev and optionally --user and/or --group.
       --mktun
              (Standalone)  Create  a  persistent  tunnel on platforms which support them such as Linux. Normally TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the period of time
              that an application has them open. This option takes advantage of the TUN/TAP driver's ability to build persistent tunnels that live through multiple
              instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are deleted or the machine is rebooted.
              One  of  the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the need for separate --up and --down scripts to run the appropriate ifconfig(8)
              and route(8) commands. These commands can be placed in the the same shell script which starts or terminates an OpenVPN session.
              Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts. This  can  be  useful  to
              provide uninterrupted connectivity through the tunnel in the event of a DHCP reset of the peer's public IP address (see the --ipchange option above).
              One disadvantage of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to automatically configure their MTU value (see --link-mtu and --tun-mtu above).
              On some platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persistent by default.
       --rmtun
              (Standalone) Remove a persistent tunnel.
   Virtual Routing and Forwarding
       Options in this section relates to configuration of virtual routing and forwarding in combination with the underlying operating system.
       As of today this is only supported on Linux, a kernel >= 4.9 is recommended.
       This  could  come  in  handy  when  for example the external network should be only used as a means to connect to some VPN endpoints and all regular traffic
       should only be routed through any tunnel(s).  This could be achieved by setting up a VRF and configuring the interface connected to the external network  to
       be part of the VRF. The examples below will cover this setup.
       Another option would be to put the tun/tap interface into a VRF. This could be done by an up-script which uses the ip link set command shown below.
   VRF setup with iproute2
       Create VRF vrf_external and map it to routing table 1023
          ip link add vrf_external type vrf table 1023
       Move eth0 into vrf_external
          ip link set master vrf_external dev eth0
       Any prefixes configured on eth0 will be moved from the :code`main` routing table into routing table 1023
   VRF setup with ifupdown
       For  Debian based Distributions ifupdown2 provides an almost drop-in replacement for ifupdown including VRFs and other features.  A configuration for an interface eth0 being part of VRF code:vrf_external could look like this:
          auto eth0
          iface eth0
              address 192.0.2.42/24
              address 2001:db8:08:15::42/64
              gateway 192.0.2.1
              gateway 2001:db8:08:15::1
              vrf vrf_external
          auto vrf_external
          iface vrf_external
              vrf-table 1023
   OpenVPN configuration
       The OpenVPN configuration needs to contain this line:
          bind-dev vrf_external

SCRIPTING INTEGRATION
       OpenVPN can execute external scripts in various phases of the lifetime of the OpenVPN process.
   Script Order of Execution
       1.  --up
           Executed after TCP/UDP socket bind and TUN/TAP open.
       2.  --tls-verify
           Executed when we have a still untrusted remote peer.
       3.  --ipchange
           Executed after connection authentication, or remote IP address change.
       4.  --client-connect
           Executed in --mode server mode immediately after client authentication.
       5.  --route-up
           Executed after connection authentication, either immediately after, or some number of seconds after as defined by the --route-delay option.
       6.  --route-pre-down
           Executed right before the routes are removed.
       7.  --client-disconnect
           Executed in --mode server mode on client instance shutdown.
       8.  --down
           Executed after TCP/UDP and TUN/TAP close.
       9.  --learn-address
           Executed in --mode server mode whenever an IPv4 address/route or MAC address is added to OpenVPN's internal routing table.
       10. --auth-user-pass-verify
           Executed in --mode server mode on new client connections, when the client is still untrusted.
   SCRIPT HOOKS
       --auth-user-pass-verify args
              Require the client to provide a username/password (possibly in addition to a client certificate) for authentication.
              Valid syntax:
                 auth-user-pass-verify cmd method
              OpenVPN will run command cmd to validate the username/password provided by the client.
              cmd consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or  double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              If  method  is  set  to via-env, OpenVPN will call script with the environmental variables username and password set to the username/password strings
              provided by the client. Beware that this method is insecure on some platforms which make the environment of a process publicly visible to  other  unprivileged processes.
              If method is set to via-file, OpenVPN will write the username and password to the first two lines of a temporary file. The filename will be passed as
              an argument to script, and the file will be automatically deleted by OpenVPN after the script returns. The location of the  temporary  file  is  controlled  by  the  --tmp-dir  option, and will default to the current directory if unspecified. For security, consider setting --tmp-dir to a volatile
              storage medium such as /dev/shm (if available) to prevent the username/password file from touching the hard drive.
              The script should examine the username and password, returning a success exit code (0) if the client's authentication request is to be accepted, or a
              failure code (1) to reject the client.
              This directive is designed to enable a plugin-style interface for extending OpenVPN's authentication capabilities.
              To  protect against a client passing a maliciously formed username or password string, the username string must consist only of these characters: alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), or at ('@'). The password string can consist of any printable characters except for CR or LF.  Any
              illegal characters in either the username or password string will be converted to underbar ('_').
              Care  must be taken by any user-defined scripts to avoid creating a security vulnerability in the way that these strings are handled. Never use these
              strings in such a way that they might be escaped or evaluated by a shell interpreter.
              For a sample script that performs PAM authentication, see sample-scripts/auth-pam.pl in the OpenVPN source distribution.
       --client-connect cmd
              Run command cmd on client connection.
              cmd consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or  double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              The  command is passed the common name and IP address of the just-authenticated client as environmental variables (see environmental variable section
              below). The command is also passed the pathname of a freshly created temporary file as the last argument (after any arguments specified in cmd ),  to
              be used by the command to pass dynamically generated config file directives back to OpenVPN.
              If  the  script wants to generate a dynamic config file to be applied on the server when the client connects, it should write it to the file named by
              the last argument.
              See the --client-config-dir option below for options which can be legally used in a dynamically generated config file.
              Note that the return value of script is significant. If script returns a non-zero error status, it will cause the client to be disconnected.
              If a --client-connect wants to defer the generating of  the  configuration  then  the  script  needs  to  use  the  client_connect_deferred_file  and
              client_connect_config_file  environment  variables,  and write status accordingly into these files.  See the Environmental Variables section for more
              details.
       --client-disconnect cmd
              Like --client-connect but called on client instance shutdown. Will not be called unless the --client-connect script and  plugins  (if  defined)  were
              previously called on this instance with successful (0) status returns.
              The  exception  to  this rule is if the --client-disconnect command or plugins are cascaded, and at least one client-connect function succeeded, then
              ALL of the client-disconnect functions for scripts and plugins will be called on client instance object deletion, even in cases where some of the related client-connect functions returned an error status.
              The --client-disconnect command is not passed any extra arguments (only those arguments specified in cmd, if any).
       --down cmd
              Run  command  cmd after TUN/TAP device close (post --user UID change and/or --chroot ). cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be  separated  by
              one or more spaces.
              Called with the same parameters and environmental variables as the --up option above.
              Note that if you reduce privileges by using --user and/or --group, your --down script will also run at reduced privilege.
       --down-pre
              Call --down cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close.
       --ipchange cmd
              Run command cmd when our remote ip-address is initially authenticated or changes.
              cmd  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              When cmd is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in cmd , as follows:
                 cmd ip address port number
              Don't use --ipchange in --mode server mode. Use a --client-connect script instead.
              See the Environmental Variables section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.
              If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP addresses of either peer could change without notice, you can  use  this  script,
              for  example,  to edit the /etc/hosts file with the current address of the peer. The script will be run every time the remote peer changes its IP address.
              Similarly if our IP address changes due to DHCP, we should configure our IP address change script (see man page for dhcpcd(8)) to deliver a SIGHUP or
              SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN. OpenVPN will then re-establish a connection with its most recently authenticated peer on its new IP address.
       --learn-address cmd
              Run command cmd to validate client virtual addresses or routes.
              cmd  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              Three arguments will be appended to any arguments in cmd as follows:
              $1 - [operation]
                     "add", "update", or "delete" based on whether or not the address is being added to, modified, or deleted from OpenVPN's internal  routing  table.
              $2 - [address]
                     The  address  being learned or unlearned. This can be an IPv4 address such as "198.162.10.14", an IPv4 subnet such as "198.162.10.0/24", or an
                     ethernet MAC address (when --dev tap is being used) such as "00:FF:01:02:03:04".
              $3 - [common name]
                     The common name on the certificate associated with the client linked to this address. Only present  for  "add"  or  "update"  operations,  not
                     "delete".
              On "add" or "update" methods, if the script returns a failure code (non-zero), OpenVPN will reject the address and will not modify its internal routing table.
              Normally, the cmd script will use the information provided above to set appropriate firewall entries on the VPN TUN/TAP interface. Since OpenVPN provides  the  association  between  virtual  IP or MAC address and the client's authenticated common name, it allows a user-defined script to configure
              firewall access policies with regard to the client's high-level common name, rather than the low level client virtual addresses.
       --route-up cmd
              Run command cmd after routes are added, subject to --route-delay.
              cmd consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or  double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              See the Environmental Variables section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.
       --route-pre-down cmd
              Run command cmd before routes are removed upon disconnection.
              cmd  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              See the Environmental Variables section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.
       --setenv args
              Set a custom environmental variable name=value to pass to script.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 setenv name value
                 setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1
                 setenv opt config_option
              By setting FORWARD_COMPATIBLE to 1, the config file syntax checking is relaxed so that unknown directives will trigger a warning but not a fatal  error, on the assumption that a given unknown directive might be valid in future OpenVPN versions.
              This  option should be used with caution, as there are good security reasons for having OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file.  Having
              said that, there are valid reasons for wanting new software features to gracefully degrade when encountered by older software versions.
              It is also possible to tag a single directive so as not to trigger a fatal error if the directive isn't recognized. To do this, prepend the following
              before the directive: setenv opt
              Versions prior to OpenVPN 2.3.3 will always ignore options set with the setenv opt directive.
              See also --ignore-unknown-option
       --setenv-safe args
              Set a custom environmental variable OPENVPN_name to value to pass to scripts.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 setenv-safe name value
              This directive is designed to be pushed by the server to clients, and the prepending of OPENVPN_ to the environmental variable is a safety precaution
              to prevent a LD_PRELOAD style attack from a malicious or compromised server.
       --tls-verify cmd
              Run command cmd to verify the X509 name of a pending TLS connection that has otherwise passed all other tests of certification (except for revocation
              via --crl-verify directive; the revocation test occurs after the --tls-verify test).
              cmd should return 0 to allow the TLS handshake to proceed, or 1 to fail.
              cmd  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              When cmd is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in cmd, as follows:
                 cmd certificate_depth subject
              These arguments are, respectively, the current certificate depth and the X509 subject distinguished name (dn) of the peer.
              This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a certificate which was signed by a certificate authority who also signed  many  other  certificates,  where you don't necessarily want to trust all of them, but rather be selective about which peer certificate you will accept. This feature
              allows you to write a script which will test the X509 name on a certificate and decide whether or not it should be accepted. For a simple perl script
              which will test the common name field on the certificate, see the file verify-cn in the OpenVPN distribution.
              See the Environmental Variables section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.
       --up cmd
              Run command cmd after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre --user UID change).
              cmd  consists of a path to a script (or executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted
              and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.
              The up command is useful for specifying route commands which route IP traffic destined for private subnets which exist at the other end  of  the  VPN
              connection into the tunnel.
              For --dev tun execute as:
                 cmd tun_dev tun_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_remote_ip [init | restart]
              For --dev tap execute as:
                 cmd tap_dev tap_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_netmask [init | restart]
              See the Environmental Variables section below for additional parameters passed as environmental variables.
              Note  that  if  cmd  includes arguments, all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended to them to build an argument list with which the executable
              will be called.
              Typically, cmd will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.
              Normally the up script is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened. In this context, the last command line parameter passed to the  script  will  be
              init.  If the --up-restart option is also used, the up script will be called for restarts as well. A restart is considered to be a partial reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is preserved (the --persist-tun option will enable such preservation).  A restart can be generated by a
              SIGUSR1  signal,  a  --ping-restart timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled with the --proto option. If a restart occurs, and
              --up-restart has been specified, the up script will be called with restart as the last parameter.
              NOTE:  On restart, OpenVPN will not pass the full set of environment variables to the script. Namely, everything related to routing and gateways will
                     not  be  passed,  as nothing needs to be done anyway - all the routing setup is already in place. Additionally, the up-restart script will run
                     with the downgraded UID/GID settings (if configured).
              The following standalone example shows how the --up script can be called in both an initialization and restart context. (NOTE: for security  reasons,
              don't  run  the following example unless UDP port 9999 is blocked by your firewall. Also, the example will run indefinitely, so you should abort with
              control-c).
                 openvpn --dev tun --port 9999 --verb 4 --ping-restart 10 \
                         --up 'echo up' --down 'echo down' --persist-tun  \
                         --up-restart
              Note that OpenVPN also provides the --ifconfig option to automatically ifconfig the TUN device, eliminating the need to define an --up script, unless
              you also want to configure routes in the --up script.
              If --ifconfig is also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig local and remote endpoints on the command line to the --up script so that they can be
              used to configure routes such as:
                 route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5
       --up-delay
              Delay TUN/TAP open and possible --up script execution until after TCP/UDP connection establishment with peer.
              In --proto udp mode, this option normally requires the use of --ping to allow connection initiation to be sensed in the absence of tunnel data, since
              UDP is a "connectionless" protocol.
              On  Windows,  this  option  will delay the TAP-Win32 media state transitioning to "connected" until connection establishment, i.e. the receipt of the
              first authenticated packet from the peer.
       --up-restart
              Enable the --up and --down scripts to be called for restarts as well as initial program start. This option is described more fully above in the  --up
              option documentation.
   String Types and Remapping
       In  certain  cases,  OpenVPN  will  perform remapping of characters in strings. Essentially, any characters outside the set of permitted characters for each
       string type will be converted to underbar ('_').
       Q: Why is string remapping necessary?
              It's an important security feature to prevent the malicious coding of strings from untrusted sources to be passed as parameters to scripts, saved  in
              the environment, used as a common name, translated to a filename, etc.
       Q: Can string remapping be disabled?
              Yes, by using the --no-name-remapping option, however this should be considered an advanced option.
       Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN's current string types and the permitted character class for each string:
       X509 Names
              Alphanumeric,  underbar  ('_'),  dash  ('-'),  dot ('.'), at ('@'), colon (':'), slash ('/'), and equal ('='). Alphanumeric is defined as a character
              which will cause the C library isalnum() function to return true.
       Common Names
              Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and at ('@').
       --auth-user-pass username
              Same as Common Name, with one exception: starting with OpenVPN 2.0.1, the username is passed to the  OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY  plugin  in
              its raw form, without string remapping.
       --auth-user-pass password
              Any "printable" character except CR or LF. Printable is defined to be a character which will cause the C library isprint() function to return true.
       --client-config-dir filename as derived from common name or`username
              Alphanumeric,  underbar  ('_'), dash ('-'), and dot ('.') except for "."  or ".." as standalone strings. As of v2.0.1-rc6, the at ('@') character has
              been added as well for compatibility with the common name character class.
       Environmental variable names
              Alphanumeric or underbar ('_').
       Environmental variable values
              Any printable character.
       For all cases, characters in a string which are not members of the legal character class for that string type will be remapped to underbar ('_').
   Environmental Variables
       Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new value or a restart,
       As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by OpenVPN are scoped according to the client objects they  are  associated  with,  so
       there should not be any issues with scripts having access to stale, previously set variables which refer to different client instances.
       bytes_received
              Total number of bytes received from client during VPN session. Set prior to execution of the --client-disconnect script.
       bytes_sent
              Total number of bytes sent to client during VPN session. Set prior to execution of the --client-disconnect script.
       client_connect_config_file
              The  path  to  the  configuration  file that should be written to by the --client-connect script (optional, if per-session configuration is desired).
              This is the same file name as passed via command line argument on the call to the --client-connect script.
       client_connect_deferred_file
              This file can be optionally written to in order to to communicate a status code of the --client-connect script or plgin.  Only the first character in
              the  file  is  relevant.   It must be either 1 to indicate normal script execution, 0 indicates an error (in the same way that a non zero exit status
              does) or 2 to indicate that the script deferred returning the config file.
              For deferred (background) handling, the script or plugin MUST write 2 to the file to indicate the deferral and then return with exit code 0 to signal
              deferred handler started OK.
              A  background process or similar must then take care of writing the configuration to the file indicated by the client_connect_config_file environment
              variable and when finished, write the a 1 to this file (or 0 in case of an error).
              The absence of any character in the file when the script finishes executing is interpreted the same as 1. This allows scripts that are not written to
              support the defer mechanism to be used unmodified.
       common_name
              The X509 common name of an authenticated client. Set prior to execution of --client-connect, --client-disconnect and --auth-user-pass-verify scripts.
       config Name of first --config file. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       daemon Set to "1" if the --daemon directive is specified, or "0" otherwise.  Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       daemon_log_redirect
              Set to "1" if the --log or --log-append directives are specified, or "0" otherwise. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       dev    The actual name of the TUN/TAP device, including a unit number if it exists. Set prior to --up or --down script execution.
       dev_idx
              On  Windows, the device index of the TUN/TAP adapter (to be used in netsh.exe calls which sometimes just do not work right with interface names). Set
              prior to --up or --down script execution.
       foreign_option_{n}
              An option pushed via --push to a client which does not natively support it, such as --dhcp-option on a non-Windows system, will be recorded  to  this
              environmental variable sequence prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_broadcast
              The broadcast address for the virtual ethernet segment which is derived from the --ifconfig option when --dev tap is used. Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_ipv6_local
              The local VPN endpoint IPv6 address specified in the --ifconfig-ipv6 option  (first  parameter).  Set  prior  to  OpenVPN  calling  the  ifconfig  or
              code:netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_ipv6_netbits
              The  prefix length of the IPv6 network on the VPN interface. Derived from the /nnn parameter of the IPv6 address in the --ifconfig-ipv6 option (first
              parameter). Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_ipv6_remote
              The  remote  VPN endpoint IPv6 address specified in the --ifconfig-ipv6 option (second parameter). Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh
              (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_local
              The local VPN endpoint IP address specified in the --ifconfig option (first parameter). Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or  netsh  (windows
              version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_remote
              The remote VPN endpoint IP address specified in the --ifconfig option (second parameter) when --dev tun is used. Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_netmask
              The subnet mask of the virtual ethernet segment that is specified as the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tap is being used.  Set  prior  to
              OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up script execution.
       ifconfig_pool_local_ip
              The  local  virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an --ifconfig-push directive if specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled by the --ifconfig-pool config file directive). Only set for --dev tun tunnels. This option is set on the server prior  to  execution  of  the
              --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts.
       ifconfig_pool_netmask
              The  virtual  IP netmask for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an --ifconfig-push directive if specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled
              by the --ifconfig-pool config file directive). Only set for --dev tap tunnels.  This  option  is  set  on  the  server  prior  to  execution  of  the
              --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts.
       ifconfig_pool_remote_ip
              The  remote virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an --ifconfig-push directive if specified, or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled by the --ifconfig-pool config file directive). This option is set on the server prior to execution of the --client-connect and  --client-disconnect scripts.
       link_mtu
              The maximum packet size (not including the IP header) of tunnel data in UDP tunnel transport mode. Set prior to --up or --down script execution.
       local  The --local parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       local_port
              The local port number or name, specified by --port or --lport.  Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       password
              The  password provided by a connecting client. Set prior to --auth-user-pass-verify script execution only when the via-env modifier is specified, and
              deleted from the environment after the script returns.
       proto  The --proto parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       remote_{n}
              The --remote parameter. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       remote_port_{n}
              The remote port number, specified by --port or --rport. Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
       route_net_gateway
              The pre-existing default IP gateway in the system routing table. Set prior to --up script execution.
       route_vpn_gateway
              The default gateway used by --route options, as specified in either the --route-gateway option or the second parameter to --ifconfig when  --dev  tun
              is specified. Set prior to --up script execution.
       route_{parm}_{n}
              A set of variables which define each route to be added, and are set prior to --up script execution.
              parm will be one of network, netmask", gateway, or metric.
              n is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.
              If  the network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address translations will be recorded rather than their names as denoted on the command
              line or configuration file.
       route_ipv6_{parm}_{n}
              A set of variables which define each IPv6 route to be added, and are set prior to --up script execution.
              parm will be one of network, gateway or metric. route_ipv6_network_{n} contains netmask as /nnn, unlike IPv4 where it is passed in a  separate  environment variable.
              n is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.
              If  the network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address translations will be recorded rather than their names as denoted on the command
              line or configuration file.
       peer_cert
              Temporary file name containing the client certificate upon connection.  Useful in conjunction with --tls-verify.
       script_context
              Set to "init" or "restart" prior to up/down script execution. For more information, see documentation for --up.
       script_type
              Prior to execution of any script, this variable is set to the type of script being run. It can be one of the following: up, down, ipchange, route-up,
              tls-verify, auth-user-pass-verify, client-connect, client-disconnect or learn-address. Set prior to execution of any script.
       signal The  reason for exit or restart. Can be one of sigusr1, sighup, sigterm, sigint, inactive (controlled by --inactive option), ping-exit (controlled by
              --ping-exit option), ping-restart (controlled by --ping-restart option), connection-reset (triggered on TCP connection reset), error or unknown  (unknown signal).  This variable is set just prior to down script execution.
       time_ascii
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a human-readable time string.  Set prior to execution of the --client-connect script.
       time_duration
              The duration (in seconds) of the client session which is now disconnecting. Set prior to execution of the --client-disconnect script.
       time_unix
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a unix integer date/time value. Set prior to execution of the --client-connect script.
       tls_digest_{n} / tls_digest_sha256_{n}
              Contains  the  certificate  SHA1  /  SHA256  fingerprint,  where n is the verification level. Only set for TLS connections. Set prior to execution of
              --tls-verify script.
       tls_id_{n}
              A series of certificate fields from the remote peer, where n is the verification level. Only set for TLS  connections.  Set  prior  to  execution  of
              --tls-verify script.
       tls_serial_{n}
              The serial number of the certificate from the remote peer, where n is the verification level. Only set for TLS connections. Set prior to execution of
              --tls-verify script. This is in the form of a decimal string like "933971680", which is suitable for doing serial-based OCSP queries  (with  OpenSSL,
              do  not  prepend  "0x"  to  the string) If something goes wrong while reading the value from the certificate it will be an empty string, so your code
              should check that. See the contrib/OCSP_check/OCSP_check.sh script for an example.
       tls_serial_hex_{n}
              Like tls_serial_{n}, but in hex form (e.g.  12:34:56:78:9A).
       tun_mtu
              The MTU of the TUN/TAP device. Set prior to --up or --down script execution.
       trusted_ip / trusted_ip6)
              Actual IP address of connecting client or peer which has been authenticated. Set prior to execution of --ipchange, --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts. If using ipv6 endpoints (udp6, tcp6), trusted_ip6 will be set instead.
       trusted_port
              Actual  port  number  of  connecting  client  or  peer  which  has  been  authenticated.  Set  prior to execution of --ipchange, --client-connect and
              --client-disconnect scripts.
       untrusted_ip / untrusted_ip6
              Actual IP address of connecting client or peer which has not been authenticated yet. Sometimes used to nmap the connecting  host  in  a  --tls-verify
              script  to  ensure  it  is  firewalled  properly. Set prior to execution of --tls-verify and --auth-user-pass-verify scripts. If using ipv6 endpoints
              (udp6, tcp6), untrusted_ip6 will be set instead.
       untrusted_port
              Actual  port  number  of  connecting  client  or  peer  which  has  not  been  authenticated  yet.  Set  prior  to  execution  of  --tls-verify   and
              --auth-user-pass-verify scripts.
       username
              The username provided by a connecting client. Set prior to --auth-user-pass-verify script execution only when the via-env modifier is specified.
       X509_{n}_{subject_field}
              An  X509  subject  field from the remote peer certificate, where n is the verification level. Only set for TLS connections. Set prior to execution of
              --tls-verify script. This variable is similar to tls_id_{n} except the component X509 subject fields are broken out, and no string  remapping  occurs
              on  these  field  values (except for remapping of control characters to "_"). For example, the following variables would be set on the OpenVPN server
              using the sample client certificate in sample-keys (client.crt). Note that the verification level is 0 for the client certificate and 1  for  the  CA
              certificate.
                 X509_0_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                 X509_0_CN=Test-Client
                 X509_0_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                 X509_0_ST=NA
                 X509_0_C=KG
                 X509_1_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                 X509_1_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                 X509_1_L=BISHKEK
                 X509_1_ST=NA
                 X509_1_C=KG
   Management Interface Options
       OpenVPN provides a feature rich socket based management interface for both server and client mode operations.
       --management args
              Enable a management server on a socket-name Unix socket on those platforms supporting it, or on a designated TCP port.
              Valid syntaxes:
                 management socket-name unix          #
                 management socket-name unix pw-file  # (recommended)
                 management IP port                   # (INSECURE)
                 management IP port pw-file           #
              pw-file,  if  specified,  is  a password file where the password must be on first line. Instead of a filename it can use the keyword stdin which will
              prompt the user for a password to use when OpenVPN is starting.
              For unix sockets, the default behaviour is to create a unix domain socket that may be connected to by any process. Use  the  --management-client-user
              and --management-client-group directives to restrict access.
              The  management  interface  provides  a special mode where the TCP management link can operate over the tunnel itself. To enable this mode, set IP to
              tunnel. Tunnel mode will cause the management interface to listen for a TCP connection on the local VPN address of the TUN/TAP interface.
              *BEWARE* of enabling the management interface over TCP. In these cases you should ALWAYS make use of pw-file to password protect the  management  interface.  Any  user  who  can  connect  to  this  TCP IP:port will be able to manage and control (and interfere with) the OpenVPN process. It is also
              strongly recommended to set IP to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) to restrict accessibility of the management server to local clients.
              While the management port is designed for programmatic control of OpenVPN by other applications, it is possible to telnet to the port, using a telnet
              client in "raw" mode. Once connected, type help for a list of commands.
              For  detailed  documentation  on the management interface, see the management-notes.txt file in the management folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.
       --management-client
              Management interface will connect as a TCP/unix domain client to IP:port specified by --management rather than listen as a TCP server or  on  a  unix
              domain socket.
              If the client connection fails to connect or is disconnected, a SIGTERM signal will be generated causing OpenVPN to quit.
       --management-client-auth
              Gives  management  interface  client  the  responsibility  to  authenticate  clients  after  their  client certificate has been verified. See management-notes.txt in OpenVPN distribution for detailed notes.
       --management-client-group g
              When the management interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only allow connections from group g.
       --management-client-pf
              Management interface clients must specify a packet filter file for each connecting client. See management-notes.txt in OpenVPN distribution  for  detailed notes.
       --management-client-user u
              When the management interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only allow connections from user u.
       --management-external-cert certificate-hint
              Allows usage for external certificate instead of --cert option (client-only). certificate-hint is an arbitrary string which is passed to a management
              interface client as an argument of NEED-CERTIFICATE notification. Requires --management-external-key.
       --management-external-key args
              Allows usage for external private key file instead of --key option (client-only).
              Valid syntaxes:
                 management-external-key
                 management-external-key nopadding
                 management-external-key pkcs1
                 management-external-key nopadding pkcs1
              The optional parameters nopadding and pkcs1 signal support for different padding algorithms. See doc/mangement-notes.txt for a  complete  description
              of this feature.
       --management-forget-disconnect
              Make OpenVPN forget passwords when management session disconnects.
              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.  It is always cached.
       --management-hold
              Start OpenVPN in a hibernating state, until a client of the management interface explicitly starts it with the hold release command.
       --management-log-cache n
              Cache the most recent n lines of log file history for usage by the management channel.
       --management-query-passwords
              Query management channel for private key password and --auth-user-pass username/password. Only query the management channel for inputs which ordinarily would have been queried from the console.
       --management-query-proxy
              Query management channel for proxy server information for a specific --remote (client-only).
       --management-query-remote
              Allow management interface to override --remote directives (client-only).
       --management-signal
              Send SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN if management session disconnects. This is useful when you wish to disconnect an OpenVPN session on user logoff.   For
              --management-client this option is not needed since a disconnect will always generate a SIGTERM.
       --management-up-down
              Report tunnel up/down events to management interface.
   Plug-in Interface Options
       OpenVPN can be extended by loading external plug-in modules at runtime.  These plug-ins must be prebuilt and adhere to the OpenVPN Plug-In API.
       --plugin args
              Loads an OpenVPN plug-in module.
              Valid syntax:
                 plugin module-name
                 plugin module-name "arguments"
              The  module-name needs to be the first argument, indicating the plug-in to load.  The second argument is an optional init string which will be passed
              directly to the plug-in.  If the init consists of multiple arguments it must be enclosed in double-quotes (").  Multiple plugin modules may be loaded
              into one OpenVPN process.
              The  module-name  argument  can be just a filename or a filename with a relative or absolute path. The format of the filename and path defines if the
              plug-in will be loaded from a default plug-in directory or outside this directory.
                 --plugin path         Effective directory used
                 ===================== =============================
                  myplug.so            DEFAULT_DIR/myplug.so
                  subdir/myplug.so     DEFAULT_DIR/subdir/myplug.so
                  ./subdir/myplug.so   CWD/subdir/myplug.so
                  /usr/lib/my/plug.so  /usr/lib/my/plug.so
              DEFAULT_DIR is replaced by the default plug-in directory, which is configured at the build time of OpenVPN. CWD is the current directory where  OpenVPN was started or the directory OpenVPN have switched into via the --cd option before the --plugin option.
              For  more  information and examples on how to build OpenVPN plug-in modules, see the README file in the plugin folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.
              If you are using an RPM install of OpenVPN, see /usr/share/openvpn/plugin. The documentation is in doc and the actual plugin modules are in lib.
              Multiple plugin modules can be cascaded, and modules can be used in tandem with scripts. The modules will be called by OpenVPN in the order that they
              are declared in the config file. If both a plugin and script are configured for the same callback, the script will be called last. If the return code
              of the module/script controls an authentication function (such as tls-verify, auth-user-pass-verify, or client-connect), then every module and script
              must return success (0) in order for the connection to be authenticated.
              WARNING:
                     Plug-ins  may  do deferred execution, meaning the plug-in will return the control back to the main OpenVPN process and provide the plug-in result later on via a different thread or process.  OpenVPN does NOT support multiple authentication plug-ins where more than one  plugin  tries
                     to do deferred authentication.  If this behaviour is detected, OpenVPN will shut down upon first authentication.
   Windows-Specific Options
       --allow-nonadmin TAP-adapter
              (Standalone) Set TAP-adapter to allow access from non-administrative accounts. If TAP-adapter is omitted, all TAP adapters on the system will be configured to allow non-admin access. The non-admin access setting will only persist for the length of time that the TAP-Win32 device object and  driver
              remain loaded, and will need to be re-enabled after a reboot, or if the driver is unloaded and reloaded. This directive can only be used by an administrator.
       --block-outside-dns
              Block DNS servers on other network adapters to prevent DNS leaks. This option prevents any application from accessing TCP or UDP port 53  except  one
              inside the tunnel. It uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and works on Windows Vista or later.
              This  option is considered unknown on non-Windows platforms and unsupported on Windows XP, resulting in fatal error. You may want to use --setenv opt
              or --ignore-unknown-option (not suitable for Windows XP) to ignore said error. Note that pushing unknown options from server does not  trigger  fatal
              errors.
       --cryptoapicert select-string
              (Windows/OpenSSL Only) Load the certificate and private key from the Windows Certificate System Store.
              Use this option instead of --cert and --key.
              This  makes it possible to use any smart card, supported by Windows, but also any kind of certificate, residing in the Cert Store, where you have access to the private key. This option has been tested with a couple of different smart cards (GemSAFE, Cryptoflex, and Swedish Post Office eID) on the
              client side, and also an imported PKCS12 software certificate on the server side.
              To select a certificate, based on a substring search in the certificate's subject:
                 cryptoapicert "SUBJ:Peter Runestig"
              To select a certificate, based on certificate's thumbprint:
                 cryptoapicert "THUMB:f6 49 24 41 01 b4 ..."
              The thumbprint hex string can easily be copy-and-pasted from the Windows Certificate Store GUI.
       --dhcp-release
              Ask Windows to release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown. This option has no effect now, as it is enabled by default starting with OpenVPN 2.4.1.
       --dhcp-renew
              Ask Windows to renew the TAP adapter lease on startup. This option is normally unnecessary, as Windows automatically triggers a DHCP renegotiation on
              the TAP adapter when it comes up, however if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property to "Always Connected", you may need this flag.
       --ip-win32 method
              When using --ifconfig on Windows, set the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address and netmask using method. Don't use this option  unless  you  are  also  using
              --ifconfig.
              manual Don't  set the IP address or netmask automatically. Instead output a message to the console telling the user to configure the adapter manually
                     and indicating the IP/netmask which OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.
              dynamic [offset] [lease-time]
                     Automatically set the IP address and netmask by replying to DHCP query messages generated by the kernel.  This mode is probably the "cleanest"
                     solution  for  setting  the TCP/IP properties since it uses the well-known DHCP protocol. There are, however, two prerequisites for using this
                     mode:
                     1. The TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to "Obtain an IP address automatically", and
                     2. OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the subnet for use as the virtual DHCP server address.
                     By default in --dev tap mode, OpenVPN will take the normally unused first address in the subnet. For example, if your  subnet  is  192.168.4.0
                     netmask  255.255.255.0, then OpenVPN will take the IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the virtual DHCP server address.  In --dev tun mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to masquerade as if it were coming from the remote endpoint.
                     The optional offset parameter is an integer which is > -256 and < 256 and which defaults to 0. If offset is positive,  the  DHCP  server  will
                     masquerade  as  the IP address at network address + offset. If offset is negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at broadcast address + offset.
                     The Windows ipconfig /all command can be used to show what Windows thinks the DHCP server address is. OpenVPN will "claim"  this  address,  so
                     make  sure  to  use  a  free address. Having said that, different OpenVPN instantiations, including different ends of the same connection, can
                     share the same virtual DHCP server address.
                     The lease-time parameter controls the lease time of the DHCP assignment given to the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in seconds. Normally  a
                     very  long  lease  time is preferred because it prevents routes involving the TAP-Win32 adapter from being lost when the system goes to sleep.
                     The default lease time is one year.
              netsh  Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows command-line "netsh" command. This method appears to work correctly on  Windows
                     XP but not Windows 2000.
              ipapi  Automatically  set the IP address and netmask using the Windows IP Helper API. This approach does not have ideal semantics, though testing has
                     indicated that it works okay in practice. If you use this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32 adapter in their
                     default state, i.e. "Obtain an IP address automatically."
              adaptive (Default)
                     Try  dynamic  method  initially and fail over to netsh if the DHCP negotiation with the TAP-Win32 adapter does not succeed in 20 seconds. Such
                     failures have been known to occur when certain third-party firewall packages installed on the client machine block the DHCP  negotiation  used
                     by  the  TAP-Win32 adapter. Note that if the netsh failover occurs, the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties will be reset from DHCP to static,
                     and this will cause future OpenVPN startups using the adaptive mode to use netsh immediately, rather than trying dynamic first.
                     To "unstick" the adaptive mode from using netsh, run OpenVPN at least once using the dynamic mode to  restore  the  TAP-Win32  adapter  TCP/IP
                     properties to a DHCP configuration.
       --pause-exit
              Put  up a "press any key to continue" message on the console prior to OpenVPN program exit. This option is automatically used by the Windows explorer
              when OpenVPN is run on a configuration file using the right-click explorer menu.
       --register-dns
              Run ipconfig /flushdns and ipconfig /registerdns on connection initiation. This is known to kick Windows into recognizing pushed DNS servers.
       --route-method m
              Which method m to use for adding routes on Windows?
              adaptive (default)
                     Try IP helper API first. If that fails, fall back to the route.exe shell command.
              ipapi  Use IP helper API.
              exe    Call the route.exe shell command.
       --service args
              Should be used when OpenVPN is being automatically executed by another program in such a context that no interaction with the  user  via  display  or
              keyboard is possible.
              Valid syntax:
                 service exit-event [0|1]
              In general, end-users should never need to explicitly use this option, as it is automatically added by the OpenVPN service wrapper when a given OpenVPN configuration is being run as a service.
              exit-event is the name of a Windows global event object, and OpenVPN will continuously monitor the state of this event object and exit  when  it  becomes signaled.
              The second parameter indicates the initial state of exit-event and normally defaults to 0.
              Multiple  OpenVPN  processes  can  be  simultaneously  executed  with  the same exit-event parameter. In any case, the controlling process can signal
              exit-event, causing all such OpenVPN processes to exit.
              When executing an OpenVPN process using the --service directive, OpenVPN will probably not have a console window  to  output  status/error  messages,
              therefore it is useful to use --log or --log-append to write these messages to a file.
       --show-adapters
              (Standalone)  Show  available  TAP-Win32  adapters which can be selected using the --dev-node option. On non-Windows systems, the ifconfig(8) command
              provides similar functionality.
       --show-net
              (Standalone) Show OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list.
       --show-net-up
              Output OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list to the syslog or log file after the TUN/TAP adapter has  been  brought  up
              and any routes have been added.
       --show-valid-subnets
              (Standalone)  Show  valid subnets for --dev tun emulation. Since the TAP-Win32 driver exports an ethernet interface to Windows, and since TUN devices
              are point-to-point in nature, it is necessary for the TAP-Win32 driver to impose certain constraints on TUN endpoint address selection.
              Namely, the point-to-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation must be the middle two addresses of a /30 subnet (netmask 255.255.255.252).
       --tap-sleep n
              Cause OpenVPN to sleep for n seconds immediately after the TAP-Win32 adapter state is set to "connected".
              This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot problems with the --ifconfig and --ip-win32 options, and is used to  give  the  TAP-Win32  adapter
              time to come up before Windows IP Helper API operations are applied to it.
       --win-sys path
              Set  the  Windows system directory pathname to use when looking for system executables such as route.exe and netsh.exe. By default, if this directive
              is not specified, OpenVPN will use the SystemRoot environment variable.
              This option has changed behaviour since OpenVPN 2.3. Earlier you had to define --win-sys env to use the SystemRoot environment variable, otherwise it
              defaulted  to  C:\\WINDOWS.  It is not needed to use the env keyword any more, and it will just be ignored. A warning is logged when this is found in
              the configuration file.
       --windows-driver drv
              Specifies which tun driver to use. Values are tap-windows6 (default) and wintun.  This is a Windows-only option.  wintun" requires --dev tun and  the
              OpenVPN process to run elevated, or be invoked using the Interactive Service.
   Standalone Debug Options
       --show-gateway args
              (Standalone) Show current IPv4 and IPv6 default gateway and interface towards the gateway (if the protocol in question is enabled).
              Valid syntax:
                 --show-gateway
                 --show-gateway IPv6-target
              For  IPv6  this  queries the route towards ::/128, or the specified IPv6 target address if passed as argument.  For IPv4 on Linux, Windows, MacOS and
              BSD it looks for a 0.0.0.0/0 route.  If there are more specific routes, the result will not always be matching the route of the IPv4 packets  to  the
              VPN gateway.
   Advanced Expert Options
       These are options only required when special tweaking is needed, often used when debugging or testing out special usage scenarios.
       --hash-size args
              Set the size of the real address hash table to r and the virtual address table to v.
              Valid syntax:
                 hash-size r v
              By default, both tables are sized at 256 buckets.
       --bcast-buffers n
              Allocate n buffers for broadcast datagrams (default 256).
       --persist-local-ip
              Preserve initially resolved local IP address and port number across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.
       --persist-remote-ip
              Preserve most recently authenticated remote IP address and port number across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart restarts.
       --prng args
              (Advanced) Change the PRNG (Pseudo-random number generator) parameters
              Valid syntaxes:
                 prng alg
                 prng alg nsl
              Changes the PRNG to use digest algorithm alg (default sha1), and set nsl (default 16) to the size in bytes of the nonce secret length (between 16 and
              64).
              Set alg to none to disable the PRNG and use the OpenSSL RAND_bytes function instead for all of OpenVPN's pseudo-random number needs.
       --rcvbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket receive buffer size. Defaults to operating system default.
       --shaper n
              Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to n bytes per second on the TCP/UDP port. Note that this will only work if mode is set to p2p.  If you  want
              to limit the bandwidth in both directions, use this option on both peers.
              OpenVPN  uses  the  following algorithm to implement traffic shaping: Given a shaper rate of n bytes per second, after a datagram write of b bytes is
              queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of (b / n) seconds before queuing the next write.
              It should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between the same two peers, allowing you to construct full-speed and reduced bandwidth tunnels  at the same time, routing low-priority data such as off-site backups over the reduced bandwidth tunnel, and other data over the full-speed tunnel.
              Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per second), you should probably use lower MTU values as well (see above),  otherwise  the
              packet latency will grow so large as to trigger timeouts in the TLS layer and TCP connections running over the tunnel.
              OpenVPN allows n to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.
       --sndbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket send buffer size. Defaults to operating system default.
       --tcp-queue-limit n
              Maximum number of output packets queued before TCP (default 64).
              When  OpenVPN  is tunneling data from a TUN/TAP device to a remote client over a TCP connection, it is possible that the TUN/TAP device might produce
              data at a faster rate than the TCP connection can support. When the number of output packets queued before sending to the  TCP  socket  reaches  this
              limit for a given client connection, OpenVPN will start to drop outgoing packets directed at this client.
       --txqueuelen n
              (Linux only) Set the TX queue length on the TUN/TAP interface.  Currently defaults to operating system default.
UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS
       Options listed in this section have been removed from OpenVPN and are no longer supported
       --client-cert-not-required
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This should be replaxed with --verify-client-cert none.
       --ifconfig-pool-linear
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This should be replaced with --topology p2p.
       --key-method
              Removed  in  OpenVPN  2.5.  This option should not be used, as using the old key-method weakens the VPN tunnel security.  The old key-method was also
              only needed when the remote side was older than OpenVPN 2.0.
       --no-iv
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This option should not be used as it weakens the VPN tunnel security.  This has been a NOOP option since OpenVPN 2.4.
       --no-replay
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  This option should not be used as it weakens the VPN tunnel security.
       --ns-cert-type
              Removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  The nsCertType field is no longer supported in recent SSL/TLS libraries.  If your certificates does not  include  key  usage
              and extended key usage fields, they must be upgraded and the --remote-cert-tls option should be used instead.
CONNECTION PROFILES
       Client configuration files may contain multiple remote servers which it will attempt to connect against.  But there are some configuration options which are
       related to specific --remote options.  For these use cases, connection profiles are the solution.
       By enacpulating the --remote option and related options within <connection> and </connection>, these options are handled as a group.
       An OpenVPN client will try each connection profile sequentially until it achieves a successful connection.
       --remote-random can be used to initially "scramble" the connection list.
       Here is an example of connection profile usage:
          client
          dev tun
          <connection>
          remote 198.19.34.56 1194 udp
          </connection>
          <connection>
          remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
          </connection>
          <connection>
          remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
          http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
          </connection>
          <connection>
          remote 198.19.36.99 443 tcp
          http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
          </connection>
          persist-key
          persist-tun
          pkcs12 client.p12
          remote-cert-tls server
          verb 3
       First we try to connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using UDP. If that fails, we then try to connect to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. If that also fails,
       then  try  connecting through an HTTP proxy at 192.168.0.8:8080 to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP. Finally, try to connect through the same proxy to a server at
       198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.
       The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a <connection> block:
       bind, connect-retry, connect-retry-max, connect-timeout, explicit-exit-notify, float, fragment, http-proxy, http-proxy-option, key-direction, link-mtu,  local, lport, mssfix, mtu-disc, nobind, port, proto, remote, rport, socks-proxy, tls-auth, tls-crypt, tun-mtu and, tun-mtu-extra.
       A  defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to apply to all <connection> profiles. If any of the above options (with the exception of remote ) appear outside of a <connection> block, but in a configuration file which has one or more <connection> blocks, the option setting will be used  as  a  default
       for <connection> blocks which follow it in the configuration file.
       For  example,  suppose  the nobind option were placed in the sample configuration file above, near the top of the file, before the first <connection> block.
       The effect would be as if nobind were declared in all <connection> blocks below it.
INLINE FILE SUPPORT
       OpenVPN allows  including  files  in  the  main  configuration  for  the  --ca,  --cert,  --dh,  --extra-certs,  --key,  --pkcs12,  --secret,  --crl-verify,
       --http-proxy-user-pass, --tls-auth, --auth-gen-token-secret, --tls-crypt and --tls-crypt-v2 options.
       Each inline file started by the line <option> and ended by the line </option>
       Here is an example of an inline file usage
          <cert>
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          [...]
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          </cert>
       When  using the inline file feature with --pkcs12 the inline file has to be base64 encoded. Encoding of a .p12 file into base64 can be done for example with
       OpenSSL by running openssl base64 -in input.p12
SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Cause OpenVPN to close all TUN/TAP and network connections, restart, re-read the configuration file (if any), and reopen TUN/TAP and network  connections.
       SIGUSR1
              Like  SIGHUP`,  except don't re-read configuration file, and possibly don't close and reopen TUN/TAP device, re-read key files, preserve local IP address/port, or preserve most recently authenticated remote IP address/port based  on  --persist-tun,  --persist-key,  --persist-local-ip  and  --persist-remote-ip options respectively (see above).
              This signal may also be internally generated by a timeout condition, governed by the --ping-restart option.
              This  signal,  when combined with --persist-remote-ip, may be sent when the underlying parameters of the host's network interface change such as when
              the host is a DHCP client and is assigned a new IP address.  See --ipchange for more information.
       SIGUSR2
              Causes OpenVPN to display its current statistics (to the syslog file if --daemon is used, or stdout otherwise).
       SIGINT, SIGTERM
              Causes OpenVPN to exit gracefully.
